0,"A small meteorite crashed into a wooded area in Nicaragua's capital of Managua overnight, the government said Sunday. Residents reported hearing a mysterious boom that left a 16-foot deep crater near the city's airport, the Associated Press reports. 

Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a ""relatively small"" meteorite that ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth."" House-sized asteroid 2014 RC, which measured 60 feet in diameter, skimmed the Earth this weekend, ABC News reports. 
Murillo said Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.

The crater left by the meteorite had a radius of 39 feet and a depth of 16 feet,  said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.

Humberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.

""We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,"" he said.

Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was ""very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.""

Local residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn't see anything strange in the sky.

""I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,"" Jorge Santamaria told The Associated Press.

The site of the crater is near Managua's international airport and an air force base. Only journalists from state media were allowed to visit it."

Two Australians say they bought a few McDonald's burgers for friends back in 1995, when they were teens, and one of the friends never showed up. So the kid's burger went uneaten?and stayed that way, Australia's News Network reports. """"We¡¯re pretty sure it¡¯s the oldest burger in the world,"""" says one of the men, Casey Dean. Holding onto the burger for their friend """"started off as a joke,"""" he adds, but """"the months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.""""

Dean and his burger-buying mate, Eduard Nitz, even took the burger on Australian TV show The Project last night and """"showed off the mold-free specimen,"""" News 9 reports. The pair offered to take a bite of it for charity but were dissuaded by the show's hosts. They've also started a Facebook page for the burger called """"Can This 20 Year Old Burger Get More Likes Than Kanye West?"""" that has more than 4,044 likes as of this writing. And they're selling an iTunes song, """"Free the Burger,"""" for $1.69, and giving proceeds to the charity Beyond Blue, which helps Australians battle anxiety and depression. (A few years ago, a man sold a 20-year-old bottle of McDonald's McJordan sauce for $10,000. Here's why Mickey D's food seemingly never decays.)"
6,"Posting photos of a gun-toting child online, ISIS supporters announced that the group¡¯s youngest soldier has died in combat.

Twitter accounts linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham claimed that the child soldier ¡°got martyred¡± with his father while fighting for the terrorist group in Syria.

Photos posted on Twitter showed the smiling boy in military fatigues holding weapons that, at times, are almost as large as his body. British media reported that the child was roughly 10 years old.

The photos of the boy first emerged in June, said Charlie Cooper, a researcher who monitors ISIS social media for the London-based Quilliam counter-extremism think tank.
In the past week, Mr. Cooper has noticed the hashtag ¡°shibal_alBaghdadi¡± ? which translates as ¡°the cub of Baghdadi¡± ? on Twitter accounts linked to ISIS.

While ISIS fighters commonly refer to themselves as lions of the Islamic State, Mr. Cooper said, they refer to child soldiers as cubs of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, ISIS¡¯s self-proclaimed caliph.

Mr. Cooper first saw ISIS supporters tweeting that the young boy was dead on Sept. 26. And while he says social media often produces fabricated reports to make ISIS seem ¡°more brutal than it is,¡± the reports of the dead child appear to be coming directly from ISIS. One Twitter account said the boy was killed in a U.S. air strike, though that has not been confirmed.

ISIS supporters identified the boy as Abu Ubaidah.

¡°It seems like a very legitimate thing,¡± Mr. Cooper said in a telephone interview Thursday, adding that ISIS is known to use child soldiers. ¡°I would vouch for it.¡±

A United Nations report on Iraq this month said children conduct patrols for ISIS, arrest and guard prisoners, carry weapons and are forced to give blood to help injured fighters. While the boy allegedly killed last month was listed as 10, the UN said child soldiers with ISIS are as young 12 and 13 years old.
Children are also frequently used in ISIS propaganda, with photos showing children in ¡°uniform and parading alongside adults being frequently posted on social media,¡± the UN reported.

¡°Everyone at NATO headquarters is worried about the use of children by ISIS,¡± said Shelly Whitman, executive director of the Halifax-based Romeo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative.

¡°If we [Canada] send boots on the ground, we¡¯re going to see this face to face,¡± she said.

Currently, the six-month Canadian mission in Iraq will be limited to air strikes, with a ban on deploying any combat troops on the ground."
7,"At least 25 suspected Boko Haram insurgents were killed in clashes between soldiers and the Islamist militants in northeast Nigeria and five civilians were killed in fighting elsewhere in the region, a military source and residents said on Monday.

A ceasefire agreement between Boko Haram and the Nigerian government was expected to lead to the liberation of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the militants six months ago, and talks were due to continue in neighbouring Chad on Monday.

Boko Haram has not confirmed the truce and there have been at least six attacks over the weekend ? blamed by security sources on the insurgents ? that have killed several dozen people since the announcement of the ceasefire.

A government spokesman has said that the fighting on Sunday may be the work of criminal gangs in the lawless region.

An army officer, who requested anonymity, said the militants tried to enter the town of Damboa late on Sunday through Alagarno, a Boko Haram hideout, but soldiers fought them off. ¡°Our men gunned down 25 of the insurgents because they would have entered Damboa and unleashed more terror on the town that is just picking up from its ruins,¡± the officer said.

He said an armoured vehicle and some arms were recovered from the insurgents.

Damboa, a garrison town near the border with Cameroon, has been the site of fierce fighting between the militants and Nigerian forces for months. The insurgents sacked the town in July but were driven out by an army counter-offensive.

A member of pro-government Civilian Joint Task Force vigilantes, Mohammed Haruna, said of clashes on Sunday, ¡°Two of our members came to [the town of] Biu this morning from Damboa and said the soldiers engaged Boko Haram yesterday and the battle lasted till about midnight.¡±

Separately, Maiduguri resident Andrew Tada, said the insurgents killed five people in Gava, a hilly town in Gwoza Local Government Area not far from Damboa.

Tada said his brother in Gava was lucky to have escaped to the top of a mountain.

¡°My brother is still there now with other relatives, women and children,¡± he told Reuters after speaking with his brother on the phone.

¡°They [the militants] came yesterday [Sunday] while people were scouting for food at the foot of the mountain. When the insurgents sighted our people, they pursued them and slaughtered five,¡± Tada said."
8,"There is so much fake stuff on the Internet in any given week that we¡¯ve grown tired of debunking it all. Fake Twitter fights. Fake DHL ads. Amazing viral video? Nope ? a Jimmy Kimmel stunt!

So, rather than take down each and every undeservedly viral story that crosses our monitors each week, we¡¯re rounding them all up in a quick, once-a-week Friday debunk of fake photos, misleading headlines and bad studies that you probably shouldn¡¯t share over the weekend.

Ready? Here¡¯s what was fake on the Internet this week:

1. The Nobel Committee doesn¡¯t ¡°regret¡± giving President Obama the Peace Prize. According to an invented ¡°news release¡± uploaded to Scribd by the prominent blogger and anti-war activist David Swanson, the Nobel Institute can¡¯t retract Obama¡¯s 2009 Peace Prize ? but wishes it could. ¡°It remains the obligation of the Committee to disassociate itself from actions taken by laureates that frustrate rather than advancing [sic] the fraternity between nations,¡± the statement reads. (Pro-tip: International organizations rarely make glaring grammatical errors in major statements.) ¡°The Committee therefore joins with the public statements of several Nobel Peace Laureates in expressing its regrets over the conduct of the 2009 prize recipient.¡± The announcement has since been picked up by a number of right-wing outlets, including Before It¡¯s News. The only problem, of course: It isn¡¯t true.

Dear Internet: The Nobel committee ¡Èregrets¡± giving Obama the 2009 peace prize story is bogus. I just spoke with the head of the institute

2. There is no-such thing as a ¡°pumpkin-spice-flavored condom.¡± Though considering the social media response to the idea, some enterprising company may want to give it a try. A Photoshopped image of the ¡°limited edition¡± Durex condom circulated widely on Twitter and Facebook last week before a punny statement from Durex punctured the hoax: ¡°We can¡¯t claim this one,¡± the company said, ¡°but we do love it when people spice it up in the bedroom.¡± Har har. In unrelated pumpkin-spice news, the limited-edition Oreos of the flavor are apparently quite real.

We¡¯ve officially reached Pumpkin Spice saturation point. pic.twitter.com/Tve77ov5JZ

3. No one expects ¡°record-shattering snowfall¡± this year. That claim ? like so many others! ? comes from the unfunny ¡°satirists¡± at EmpireNews.net, increasingly our least favorite fake-news site in a generally unfavorable field. According to the story and its accompanying map, meteorologists have expected ¡°above normal snowfall¡± in huge swaths of the United States, including the entire mid-Atlantic coast. Like everything else on Empire News, of course, the map is fake. Moreover, it¡¯s so difficult to predict seasonal weather patterns that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration doesn¡¯t bust theirs out until November, and the Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Md., told the Baltimore Sun they have virtually no idea what the snow will look like three long months from now.

#InOtherNews I just read a report that a meteorologist said we will be having ¡Èrecord shattering snowfall¡± this winter. Lord Jesus.

4. ¡°Male birth control¡± will probably not be here by 2017. A number of outlets gleefully proclaimed the news that a ¡°male birth control¡± injection, called Vasalgel, would be hitting the world¡¯s bedrooms within three years. Alas, that would seem to suggest that Vasalgel has been proven to work in humans, or that it¡¯s already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration ? and neither of those things are true. ¡°The news came from a press release ? and call for donations! ? by the foundation behind Vasalgel,¡± Julia Belluz explained at Vox, ¡°highlighting some promising (though again, unpublished, anecdotal findings) from testing on baboons.¡± Bottom line: It¡¯s great that someone¡¯s working on male birth control, but it¡¯s highly unlikely this particular product will reach the U.S. market by 2017.

5. There was not a shooting at a California Marine Corps base. An anonymous Facebook page sparked all-out panic at a base north of San Diego on Thursday night when it posted that a shooter was active at the military installation and that ¡°ALL MARINES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO LOCK THEMSELVES INSIDE OF THEIR ROOMS.¡± The page then stupidly followed that prank post up with a number of ¡°updates¡± on the situation, which were liked and shared hundreds of times. Base police told Business Insider there was no evidence at all of a shooting: People ¡°saw if on social media networks and then they started telling their friends,¡± one dispatcher said. ¡°It¡¯s all rumor, it¡¯s all hearsay.¡±

Possible shooter in Camp Pendleton!? Anybody hear anything??

6. Shakira is not dead. The singer¡¯s hips don¡¯t lie, but the Internet does. Constantly. A hoax e-mail bearing the logo of Mexican newspaper El Universal claimed that Shakira died in a car accident in Colombia last week, and that an attached Word document contained ¡°exclusive images and details¡± from the scene. Colombia¡¯s Informador reports that the e-mail may actually have contained a virus or phishing scam. As for Shakira, she¡¯s alive and well and expecting her second child with boyfriend Gerard Pique.

7. British Muslims are not trying to outlaw a beloved children¡¯s TV show. A comedian going by the name Zayn Sheikh outraged many Brits (and fooled a number of news outlets, British and otherwise) with a YouTube video that demanded the TV show ¡°Peppa Pig¡± go off air and suggested a national campaign would soon organize for that purpose. Peppa Pig is a beloved, alliterative British cartoon character ? and also ¡°haram,¡± or forbidden to Muslims, Sheikh claimed. Over the weekend, Sheikh posted a second video admitting the whole thing was a hoax ? but a hoax for a cause. ¡°This video served to show how much Islamophobia is around, for those who deny its existence,¡± he wrote. ¡°It is sad to live in a society where some feel that Muslims have no rights to talk at all.¡±

8. Obama will not ¡°resign amid new Benghazi revelations.¡± Every word of this headline is a dream come true to some of the president¡¯s more conspiracy-minded opponents, which perhaps explains why the fake article, from fake-article-generator National Report, went viral in those circles. As of this writing, it¡¯s been shared more than 60,000 times on Facebook. Even Donald Trump seems to have fallen for the ¡°joke¡±!

If Obama resigns from office NOW, thereby doing a great service to the country?I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses!

(Just kidding, that tweet is related to another matter entirely.)

9. Cocaine has not been found in Coors Light beer. Since this is the second widespread cocaine-in-a-beverage hoax in as many weeks, let¡¯s get a few things straight about the alleged phenomenon. First up: This hoax seems to do well because it has some remote, and long ago, bases in fact. (Cocaine-laced sodas and beverages were very popular in ye olden days, around the time of the Civil War.) It also helps that remote traces of coca have been found, at some point in time, in various popular beverages, including Red Bull. That said, no cocaine expose published on a site called Huzlers.com is ever going to be real. Ever. How have 286,000 people shared this stupid thing?

10. The ruins of an ancient city were not discovered in the Australian desert. Perhaps the most incredible thing about this faux-story from World News Daily Report ? besides the number of times people have reposted it to Facebook ? is the amazingly credulous conversation readers are having in the comments section below it. ¡°I thought the climate in central Australia had been arid for over 30,000 years,¡± one commenter wrote. ¡°30,000 people living in the desert? That would require agriculture and irrigation ¡¦ That¡¯s just incredible!¡± Indeed.

Did we miss any other notable fake stuff this week? E-mail caitlin.dewey@washpost.com ? or stay tuned until next week, because surely some more shenanigans will go down in the meantime."
9,"(CNN) -- A meteorite crashed down in Managua, Nicaragua, late Saturday night, causing a loud explosion and leaving a crater 39 feet (12 meters) across, government officials said, according to The Associated Press. No damage or injuries were reported.

AP quoted government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo as saying they've determined it was a """"relatively small"""" meteorite that """"appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.""""

NASA hasn't confirmed a link between the meteorite and the asteroid. The newly discovered asteroid, called 2014 RC, was expected to pass safely above the Earth on Sunday, NASA said, at a distance of about 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers) -- just one-tenth the distance from the center of Earth to the moon. It was estimated to be 60 feet (18 meters) long.

Local media reported that scientists are trying to find remains of the meteorite, and Nicaragua is asking the United States to help investigate the event.

""""All the evidence that we've confirmed on-site corresponds exactly with a meteorite,"""" Jose Millan with the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies was quoted as saying on the Today Nicaragua website.

But NASA's Bill Cooke is skeptical.

""""It has been suggested that a meteorite may have caused this crater; however, the lack of fireball reports from the surrounding populated area seems to suggest some other cause,"""" Cooke wrote in a NASA blog post.

""""The skies were partially clear, and an object capable of producing a crater this large would have also generated a very bright fireball (brighter than the Full Moon) that should have been seen over a wide area.""""

The Today Nicaragua site reported the crater was found after a loud blast about 11:05 p.m. on Saturday. The Nicaragua Dispatch said the hole is in the woods near Managua's Sandino International Airport and about 1,000 feet (300 meters) from the Camino Real Hotel.

NASA's Near Earth Object Program estimates there are thousands of asteroids that could threaten Earth, but experts say none of the ones being tracked is expected to hit the planet anytime soon.

Sometimes, though, space rocks sneak by the scientists and amateur astronomers who track them. On February 15, 2013, a nearly 60-foot-wide meteor plunged into Earth's atmosphere and exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk with the force of about 30 nuclear bombs. The blast injured about 1,500 people.

The Chelyabinsk meteor was undetected before it was spotted by local residents as it streaked across the sky. It exploded on the same day that Asteroid 2012 DA14, one that was being carefully tracked by NASA, safely passed by Earth.

NASA is trying to speed up the way it tracks potentially hazardous asteroids and to learn how to deflect rocks that threaten Earth. Its Asteroid Initiative includes a plan to capture an asteroid and tug it into orbit around the moon in the 2020s. If it works, astronauts will land on the asteroid, take samples and bring them back to Earth.

Word has it that Amazon is looking to launch an ad-supported streaming video service, which could give rivals a run for their money. The online retail giant is planning to roll out the new service early next year, the New York Post reported on Friday. It would be separate from Amazon's $99 yearly Prime membership, which offers unlimited movie streaming from the Instant Video library.
In a statement, an Amazon spokeswoman neither confirmed nor denied the rumor.
""""We currently offer the first episode of some television shows free with ads through our First Episode Free feature on Amazon Instant Video, and there are display ads on some short videos such as movie and game trailers,"""" the spokeswoman said. """"We're often experimenting with new offers and experiences for customers, but we have not announced any plans to offer an ad-supported video streaming service.""""
This isn't the first time we've heard this rumor. The Wall Street Journal in March reported that Amazon was planning to launch its own advertising-filled TV streaming service ? free to users, of course. Amazon, however, quickly shot down that rumor.
""""We're often experimenting with new things, but we have no plans to offer a free streaming-media service,"""" an Amazon spokesperson said at the time.

But the Post's sources now say an ad-supported version is definitely happening. But oddly, the report suggests that it might not be free. One source speculated that Amazon may undercut Netflix's current monthly price of $7.99, though.
""""The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesn't want to pay for Prime, in order to increase their video share,"""" a source told the news outlet.
Meanwhile, Amazon is already gaining ground on streaming rivals. A recent Sandvine study found that Amazon Instant Video has established itself as the second largest paid streaming video service in North America, though Netflix still dominates.
Netflix accounted for 34.9 percent of downstream North American traffic in the peak evening hours this year. Amazon had only 2.6 percent of downstream traffic, but its share has more than doubled in the past 18 months, Sandvine said.
On other news, Amazon is also mulling its own travel service, which would let you book stays at independent hotels and resorts, according to a report from travel news site Skift. The so-called Amazon Travel site, set to launch around Jan. 1, would reportedly """"feature a curated selection of hotels within a few hours' drive from New York, Los Angeles, and Seattle.""""
Amazon declined to comment about the travel site rumor.

According to an unverified report, Father John Micheal O¡¯Neal, 71, briefly went to heaven and met a ¡®warm and comforting¡¯ motherly figure as doctors battled to save his life at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Although doctors feared that the religious cleric would have suffered brain damage, he woke up only 48 hours later and has recovered from the heart attack.

Recalling his experience, the priest apparently said that he was engulfed by a feeling of unconditional love as he met God, who he described as a mother-like ¡®being of light¡¯.

He said: ¡®Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting.

O¡¯Neal has reportedly said that he will continue to spread the word of God, despite the Archbishop of Boston moving to rubbish the claims of a ¡®Holy Mother¡¯.

He added: ¡®I wish to continue preaching. I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all Catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman.¡¯"

U.S. military officials say they are investigating claims that Islamic State fighters seized a cache of weapons that were airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces and meant for Kurdish militiamen.

A video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State showed a cache of weapons including hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. Their claims would appear to correspond with those of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said the militants had seized at least one cache.

U.S. officials said Tuesday they could not confirm the video's authenticity but are looking into the claims.

""""We just don't know. We're still looking at it,"""" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said when asked about the video, while stressing that the """"vast majority"""" of supplies ended up in the right hands.

The supplies were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobani that lies near the Turkish border. The militant Islamic State has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

In all, 28 bundles of equipment -- including medical supplies, weapons and ammunition -- were dropped. The Pentagon says 27 bundles were received.

According to Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren, """"one of those bundles drifted off course."""" But he said """"we subsequently destroyed it with an airstrike.""""

On Tuesday, though, Islamic State loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said """"Team USA.""""

Kirby acknowledged the conflicting accounts. """"We're aware that one bundle did not make it into the right hands and you saw the CENTCOM release indicating that they destroyed it from the air,"""" he said. """"All of that doesn't take away from the notion that this video is out there and that it could in fact be that bundle. We just don't know.""""

The lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

On Tuesday, U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed Islamic State fighting positions, a building and a large Islamic State unit.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S.-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria.

16,"Kai the shar pei-crossbreed was discovered tied to a railing outside Ayr railway station in Scotland with a case containing a pillow, toy, food and bowl

A dog has been found abandoned at a railway station along with a suitcase filled with his belongings.

The Scottish SPCA is keen to trace the owner of shar pei-crossbeed Kai, who was discovered tied to a railing outside Ayr station on Friday.

He was accompanied by a case containing items including a pillow, toy, food and bowl.

The dog was sold on the Gumtree website in 2013 and the charity is appealing for information to help trace whoever bought him.

Scottish SPCA inspector Stewart Taylor said: ""The dog is microchipped and we were able to find out his name is Kai.

""We contacted the owner registered to the microchip, who stated they had sold Kai on Gumtree in 2013. Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him.

PA   Pooch passing through: Kai was found tied to a railing at Ayr station

""This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about.

""Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible. If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible.

""Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature. We will look after him until we can find him a permanent and loving home.""

Station staff looked after Kai until the Scottish SPCA arrived at the scene on Friday.

He is now being cared for at the charity's centre in Glasgow.

The charity said abandoning an animal is an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 and anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or life."
17,"An article saying NASA confirmed six days of ¡°total darkness¡± in December is fake and it¡¯s merely an iteration of an old Internet hoax.

Essentially every year, there¡¯s bogus rumors saying that there will be three days of darkness in December, but they¡¯ve obviously proven not to be true.

They seem to reference the Three Days of Darkness mentioned by Catholic prophets.

However, a ¡°satirical¡± and entertainment website, Huzlers.com, posted an article about six days of darkness. It uses fake quotes from a NASA official.

¡°WORLDWIDE ? NASA has confirmed that the Earth will experience 6 days of almost complete darkness and will happen from the dates Tuesday the 16 ? Monday the 22 in December. The world will remain, during these three days, without sunlight due to a solar storm, which will cause dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus, block 90% sunlight,¡± it reads in part.

But Huzlers has a disclaimer that says it¡¯s not real and shouldn¡¯t ever be taken seriously.

¡°Huzlers.com is a combination of real shocking news and satirical entertainment to keep its visitors in a state of disbelier,¡± the About Us section reads on the bottom of each web page.

The bogus NASA article had tens of thousands of shares and ¡°likes¡± on Saturday.

According to Snopes.com, similar rumors have been going on for a while and have taken on different forms.

¡°No, the universe is not about to realign in December 2014, nor will there be a three-day blackout at that time during which the Earth will shift into a new dimension. Neither NASA nor any other credible scientific entity has made such a pronouncement. Ever,¡± the site says. ¡°This item originated back in 2012, when interest in the belief that the Mayan calendar would end on 21 December 2012 (thus foretelling the end of the world as we know it) was running high, and it has simply been updated and recirculated with the year 2014 replacing the original references to 2012.¡±"

22,"HBO's subscription streaming service will be called HBO Now and is expected to cost $15 per month, according to the International Business Times. The report says that HBO is targeting a launch for Now in early April, ahead of the start date for Game of Thrones. While Game of Thrones would be a great way for HBO to drive subscriptions to the new service, it'll have to be careful if it plans to do that: last year, HBO's online streaming option for cable subscribers, HBO Go, wouldn't work for many who were trying to watch during the premiere. That would be a very bad look for a new service, and the Times says that HBO doesn't plan on launching until it's satisfied that it can do so without issue.

$15/MONTH WOULD MAKE HBO'S SERVICE NEARLY TWICE THE COST OF NETFLIX

Apple is reportedly one of the partners that HBO could launch its new service with. According to the Times, Apple has been aggressive in its attempts to secure a place as one of HBO's launch partners. If a deal is made, Apple TV users would be able to access and stream HBO Now, potentially through a standalone app. Apple has been adding more and more channels to the Apple TV over the last couple years, and the addition of HBO's subscription streaming service would make its device all the more appealing. The Times notes that HBO's parent company wants to see this service be accessible on platforms like the Roku, Xbox, and PlayStation as well, but it's not clear if discussions are ongoing. Nonetheless, it seems likely that HBO would want to work with multiple major partners to get this service out there.

It's still not known what HBO's subscription streaming service will actually offer. Though many will hope for the same access that HBO Go receives ? that is, all of HBO's original content and the movies it's currently playing ? it's possible that won't be the case. HBO may want to position this service as something distinctly different from its cable service as a way to prevent subscribers from moving online. On the other hand, the $15 per month fee may mean that HBO is earning about as much regardless of how you subscribe. That price would make it tougher to compete with Netflix, but HBO hasn't exactly had trouble finding people willing to pay subscription fees that high in the past. With the even wider audience that this service will open it up to, HBO may not be that worried."
23,"In a sprawling Facebook post and subsequent interview with Radar Online, a woman named Taylor Lianne Chandler has made a number of fascinating claims about herself and her alleged relationship with Michael Phelps. Among them: she was born intersex with ambiguous genitalia, met the Olympic swimmer on Tinder, and fucked said Olympic swimmer on their first date watching football on TV.

""""Many of you have wondered why I was so freaked out about my relationship with Michael Phelps being exposed,"""" the 41-year-old D.C.-area woman begins her post. """"Here is the truth.""""

I was born intersex and named David Roy Fitch at birth. By the time I could walk and talk I made it clear I was a girl and dressed as one. In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery.
Citing an anonymous tipster (that could very well have been Chandler herself), The Hollywood Gossip previously named Chandler as Michael Phelps' companion the night of his latest DUI, a claim repeated in her recent Facebook post.

Yes, I was with Michael the night of the DUI, the story of the Uber and crying and me wanting to stay with him that night are true. A lot of the other things printed are lies. I am probably going to lose him because he is a brand that his team wants to protect and things since he went to rehab came to my attention that didn't put him or our relationship in the best light. He is the first man I ever had intimacy with and felt comfortable and all woman.
Today, Chandler followed up her announcement by giving Radar Online additional details of her supposed first date with Phelps after meeting him on Tinder, which involved watching a Baltimore Ravens game at the athlete's home. """"One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,"""" Chandler told the site. """"Later, we had sex again.""""

Chandler says she only told Phelps about her past once the """"threat of the media exposing me forced me too.""""

I am telling my story to take the power away from the media and tabloids that want to hurt Michael and I. I will probably lose him, which hurts like hell.

The rumor started when a Facebook page was made to memorialize the actor.

""""At about 11 a.m. ET on Thursday (November 06, 2014), our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away. Macaulay Culkin was born on August 26, 1980 in New York. He will be missed but not forgotten.

25,"DUBAI - A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric has whipped up controversy by issuing a religious ruling forbidding the building of snowmen, describing them as anti-Islamic.

Asked on a religious website if it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for their children after a snowstorm in the country's north, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid replied: """"It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.""""

Quoting from Muslim scholars, Sheikh Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, an action considered sinful under the kingdom's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.

""""God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,"""" he wrote in his ruling.

That provoked swift responses from Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names.

""""They are afraid for their faith of everything ... sick minds,"""" one Twitter user wrote.

Another posted a photo of a man in formal Arab garb holding the arm of a """"snow bride"""" wearing a bra and lipstick. """"The reason for the ban is fear of sedition,"""" he wrote.

A third said the country was plagued by two types of people:

""""A people looking for a fatwa (religious ruling) for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa,"""" the user wrote.

Sheikh Munajjid had some supporters, however. """"It (building snowmen) is imitating the infidels, it promotes lustiness and eroticism,"""" one wrote.

""""May God preserve the scholars, for they enjoy sharp vision and recognize matters that even Satan does not think about.""""

Snow has covered upland areas of Tabuk province near Saudi Arabia's border with Jordan for the third consecutive year as cold weather swept across the Middle East."
26,"Eran Cicurel, an editor at Voice of Israel, has quoted YPG fighters familiar with the situation in Kobani, saying that Gill Rosenberg was not captured by IS. Cicurel's claims contradict IS claims, which made announcements on IS-affiliated websites Samoach al-Islam, al-Platform Media, and Twitter that Rosenberg had been captured. Earlier in the day, IS media sources even alleged that a video was coming soon. Considering the scale of yesterday's IS advance, the story appeared plausible. Close friends, comrades, and supporters also voiced credible concern on Rosenberg's Facebook page. The YPG fighters noted, through Cicurel, that Rosenberg was not in the city of Hoban at the time that IS claims she was abducted. They also called the story """"mere propaganda"""". While not a confirmation per se, Cicurel's claims, in addition to circumstantial evidence, have made the story of Rosenberg's capture implausible. Established Israeli sources exclusively ran the story purporting to be primary sources of reporting Rosenberg's capture. The Haaretz Israeli News, the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post, and Ynet News almost immediately published similar reports, while media outside Israel have either not reported on the story or quoted the Israeli media. It is illegal for an Israeli citizen to travel to an Israeli-declared hostile state, including Iraq and Syria, for any reason including business and media reporting. Rosenberg, age 31, has become infamous in recent months for joining YPG fighters in Kobani despite the illegality of her endeavor. In the past 24 hours, an IS advance pushed the YPG back on four fronts, including the northern side that borders Turkey. However, the YPG has mitigated many IS gains, due to US airstrikes and the arrival of Turkish forces sealing the border to the north. Despite the new information, little is still publicly known about Rosenberg's status at this time. Pro-IS sources are still claiming that she is captured, while other sources are staying quiet.

27,"Phoenix, AZ ? A Phoenix boy is behind bars tonight after his mother called 9-1-1 when she found her son in his room, watching pornography and masturbating. Phoenix Police were quick to respond, arresting 15-year-old Paul Horner, who attends North Valley High School in Phoenix, Arizona. Now the teenager is being held without bail and charged by prosecutors under a new controversial Arizona state law called ¡®Self-Rape¡¯, which carries a minimum of 3 years in prison with a maximum of 15 years behind bars depending on that individuals past criminal history.

This is the first time this new state law has been used since it was put into action last month by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer. Brewer spoke with local news station ABC 15 about the charges against the boy.

¡°I applaud the Arizona District court systems here in Phoenix,¡± Brewer said. ¡°This is exactly why I implemented the state law of ¡®Self-Rape¡¯ last month and this is exactly what it is meant to be used for. Before my time as governor is up early next year, I¡¯ll do whatever I can to ensure that tragedies like this don¡¯t happen again. We need to educate our children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation before it¡¯s too late.¡±

Horner, after hearing his charges by the Honorable Judge Stevens of the United States District Court in Phoenix, which included the brand new ¡®Self-Rape¡¯ state law, Horner immediately broke down into tears and had to be restrained by bailiffs.

Transcripts of the 9-1-1 call were released to the public:

¡°911, what¡¯s your emergency?¡±

¡°Help! My son is watching porn and masturbating! That is not allowed in his house and I don¡¯t know what kind of demons possessed him to degrade his body in such a matter. I¡¯m so shakin¡¯ up! Please send help immediately!¡±

32-year-old Adeline Horner, Horner¡¯s mother, who is a self-proclaimed fanatical Baptist follower, told CNN she is still in shock.

¡°Up until now, my young, precious boy had no run-ins with the law, no drugs or alcohol, was a straight-A student, was in numerous extra curricular activities and played starting center on the boys Varsity basketball team,¡± Horner¡¯s mother said. ¡°But somewhere along the way he started playing on the Devil¡¯s playground. Hopefully because of my quick thinking and actions my son will soon be able to get the help he so badly needs. I pray for it; please Jesus, save our family!¡±

Winters controversial actions have been applauded by some, for example, Lonnie Childs, president and founder of the federally funded Christian anti-masturbation organization STOP Masturbation NOW.

¡°STOP Masturbation NOW ministries have nominated Adeline Horner for our coveted Mother of the Year award,¡± Childs told reporters. ¡°She really stepped up, provided moral discipline and leadership under such difficult conditions. My prayer app has been activated and I send this brave, courageous woman nothing but the best during these difficult times. I encourage you all all to do the same.¡±

A mascot for the Christian organization, Fappy The Ant-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is 36-year-old Paul Horner from Phoenix, Arizona, told reporters he is pleased with the justice served today and is confident this will set a precedent for all the would be masturbators out there.

¡°Fappy¢ç has helped tens of thousands of adults and children around the world learn to live a masturbation-free lifestyle. During our visits to schools around the world, our organization has collected thousands of signatures from children promising to never masturbate; we have done great things. Our organization is passionate about the great work that we do. The children even have a nickname for Fappy¢ç, they call him the tickle monster. Working side by side with such great women as Jan Brewer, we¡¯re ridding the demons from these heathens pants, one pair of pants at a time. Fappy¢ç vows to stay on this case until justice is served!¡±

Tom Downey with the Phoenix Police Department, who took the child into custody, spoke with Arizona news station Fox 10 News about the arrest.

¡°We thought at first he was possibly intoxicated or mentally unstable, ya know, talking about how we should leave him alone and just let him watch his filth, makes me sick! It¡¯s a slippery slope my friend, one day it¡¯s masturbating to porn, the next day it¡¯s raping some innocent school girl. Thank God we got this heathen off the streets before another tragedy could have occurred.¡± Downey continued, ¡°There¡¯s no better feeling than putting the real bad guys behind bars. Nothing better than that. I know I can sleep better at night just knowing another criminal is off the streets.¡±

Officers confiscated the pornography and lube found in the teenagers room as evidence.

Prosecutors told local reporters that based on the severity of the crime, the new Arizona state law of Self-Rape [A.R.S. ¡×¡× 29-169 & 48-69] would carry a minimum of 3 years with a maximum of 15 years depending on that criminals past history.

Horner is currently being held at the Maricopa County Jail in Phoenix, Arizona. He presently has no bond set and the judge has restricted him from seeing visitors. Horner¡¯s next scheduled court appearance is December 2nd.

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin and Stop Masturbation Now are federally funded programs designed to teach both children and adults about the dangers and consequences of masturbation.

29,"Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary is a former West London rapper who performed under the name L Jinny.

A British rapper now fighting with the Islamic State (aka ISIS) is reportedly a suspect in the beheading of American journalist James Foley, according to several unconfirmed published reports, including the Independent.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 24, a former West London rapper who performed under the name L Jinny, is allegedly one of three British jihadists identified as possibly being the masked murderer known as ¡°John the Beatle,¡± according to the Daily Mail.

A former hostage held by ISIS said Bary is one of several jihadists nicknamed ¡°The Beatles¡± because of their British accents. He has a similar accent, build and skin tone to ¡°John,¡± the man who killed Foley, according to a report published in the Telegraph. 

""""We have not identified who the man in the video is at this time,"""" a representative from Scotland Yard told Billboard.

Bary was an aspiring rapper whose music was played on BBC Radio in 2012, according to the Independent. He left his home in Maida Vale, West London, to fight in Syria¡¯s civil war, saying he was ¡°leaving everything for the sake of Allah,¡± the Daily Mail reports.

Bary¡¯s songs have been posted online, with titles like ¡°Overdose,¡± ¡°Flying High,¡± ¡°Dreamer¡± and ¡°The Beginning.¡± His music makes reference to violence, drug use and threats of his family being deported to Egypt. ¡°I can¡¯t differentiate the angels from the demons, my heart¡¯s disintegrating. I ain't got normal feelings,¡± he reportedly raps in one song.

Bary, one of six children, is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trial on charges tied to the deadly bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, according to the New York Post. Earlier this year, Bary reportedly tweeted a gruesome photo of himself holding a severed head under the name ¡°Terrorist¡± (@ItsLJinny). The account has since been deactivated.

No other outlet has confirmed the news."
30,"DNA tests confirm Lebanon is holding the young daughter of Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the country's interior minister says.

Nohad Machnouk told Lebanon's MTV television that the child's mother, who is also in custody, was now believed to be one of Baghdadi's ex-wives.

On Tuesday, Lebanese security officials said they had detained his wife and son at a border crossing with Syria.

But Iraq's government later insisted the woman was not married to Baghdadi.

It said the woman - identified as Saja al-Dulaimi - was the daughter of an active member of al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, al-Nusra Front.

She is also thought to have been detained by the Syrian authorities before being freed in March as part of a prisoner exchange with al-Nusra.

Pregnant

Late on Wednesday, Mr Machnouk told MTV that Ms Dulaimi had been travelling with two sons and a daughter when they were detained by the army two weeks ago.

""""Dulaimi is not Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's wife currently. She has been married three times: first to a man from the former Iraqi regime, with whom she had two sons,"""" he said.

""""Six years ago she married Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi for three months, and she had a daughter with him. Now, she is married to a Palestinian and she is pregnant with his child.""""

The minister added: """"We conducted DNA tests on her and the daughter, which showed she was the mother of the girl, and that the girl is [Baghdadi's] daughter, based on DNA from Baghdadi from Iraq.""""

It is not clear how the Iraqi authorities have the IS leader's DNA. However, in 2005 he was arrested by US forces in Iraq and spent the next four years a prisoner at Camp Bucca, near the southern town of Um Qasr, before being handed over to the Iraqi authorities and then released.

Mr Machnouk said Ms Dulaimi's children were staying at a care centre while she was being interrogated at the defence ministry's headquarters.

IS has not commented on their detention, but al-Nusra has condemned it.

One Lebanese official has said it is a """"powerful card to apply pressure"""" in negotiations with IS and al-Nusra, who are holding more than 20 Lebanese soldiers and police hostage. They are threatening to kill them unless militants are freed from Lebanese jails."
32,"FERGUSON, St. Louis (CNN) ? Could a newly released audio provide more clues on what led up to Michael Brown¡¯s shooting death?

The FBI has questioned a man who says he recorded audio of gunfire at the time Brown was shot by Ferguson police on August 9, the man¡¯s attorney told CNN.

In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots ? a cluster of six, followed by four.

¡°I was very concerned about that pause ¡¦ because it¡¯s not just the number of gunshots, it¡¯s how they¡¯re fired,¡± the man¡¯s attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN¡¯s Don Lemon. ¡°And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.¡±

The man, who asked that his identity not be revealed, lives near the site of the shooting and was close enough to have heard the gunshots, his attorney said.

He was speaking to a friend on a video chat service and happened to be recording the conversation at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.

The attorney said she learned of the man¡¯s recording late last week from a mutual friend.

¡°I had to get his consent before I could reach out to the FBI,¡± Blumenthal said.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the tape and has asked the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the man who made the recording.

The meaning of the pause

It¡¯s difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports.

Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots.

¡°It¡¯s the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless ? he has no weapon,¡± said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell.

Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer.

But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn¡¯t automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.

¡°To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,¡± said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN¡¯s Crossfire. ¡°Maybe the officer will say, ¡®Well I fired, and he kept advancing, so I fired again.'¡±

Witnesses and a friend of Officer Darren Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led up to Brown¡¯s death.

Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown¡¯s who was walking with him at the time of the shooting, said the officer shot Brown once by the police car and again as he ran away.

According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting.

But a friend of Wilson said Brown mocked the officer and charged at him before the shooting began.

An autopsy showed that all the entry wounds were in the front of Brown¡¯s body.

Key witness speaks out

Ferguson police said Brown allegedly robbed a convenience storeshortly before the shooting.

And reports that his friend Johnson had a criminal record that including lying to police has put Johnson¡¯s credibility in question.

In 2011, Johnson was arrested and accused of theft and lying to police about his first name, age and address.

Johnson said Monday night he doesn¡¯t understand why some are questioning his credibility.

¡°I see they bring up my past, my history, but it¡¯s not like it¡¯s a long rap sheet,¡± Johnson told Lemon. ¡°This one incident shouldn¡¯t make me a bad person.¡±"
34,"Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, who went by the rap name L. Jinny or Lyricist Jinn, is a suspect in the beheading of journalist James Foley this week.

Bary, 24, is said to have left home last year to join rebels in Syria. According to TMZ, he had music played on the BBC.

The Independent newspaper reported that he tweeted a photo of himself holding up a severed head earlier in August. ¡±Chillin¡¯ with my homie or what¡¯s left of him,¡± he tweeted.

Ex-ISIS hostages have said that he has the nickname ¡°John the Beatle¡± because of his British accent. Some analysts have said that the killer in the Foley video had a British accent.

Bary had lived in Maida Vale, located in west London, reported the Independent.

His father was Adel Abdul Bary, an Egyptian refugee who is said to have been an aide to Osama bin Laden.

In tracks he uploaded to YouTube in 2012, Bary talks about violence and drug use. ¡±It¡¯s hard to progress in the future with a damaged past but still I try to count my blessings and I thank Allah,¡± he said in one of his tracks. ¡±I¡¯m trying to change my ways but there¡¯s blood on my hands and I can¡¯t change my ways until there¡¯s funds in the bank.

He added: ¡°I can¡¯t differentiate the angels from the demons, my heart¡¯s disintegrating. I ain¡¯t got normal feelings.¡±

The Associated Press update: Obama again faces tug of military action in Syria WASHINGTON (AP) ? For three years, President Barack Obama has resisted the pull of potential U.S. military action in Syria.

He has held firm even as the civil war¡¯s death toll climbed toward 200,000, the Syrian government used chemical weapons against civilians and Islamic State militants strengthened amid the chaos.

Now Obama must decide whether the extremist group¡¯s murder of American journalist James Foley, as well as the broader threat the group could pose to U.S. interests, should change his cautious calculus.

Pressure is coming from his own military leaders to go after the Islamic State inside Syria. But he must weigh that against his aversion to the risks that could come with plunging the United States into a country torn apart by an intractable internal conflict.

White House officials have suggested that airstrikes in Syria are an option, though the officials say specific military proposals has not yet been presented to the president.

¡°We¡¯re actively considering what¡¯s going to be necessary to deal with that threat, and we¡¯re not going to be restricted by borders,¡± said Ben Rhodes, Obama¡¯s deputy national security adviser. ¡°We¡¯ve shown time and again that if there¡¯s a counterterrorism threat, we¡¯ll take direct action against that threat, if necessary.¡±

Even before Foley¡¯s murder, Obama found himself on far different footing in the Middle East than he probably expected in the sixth year of his presidency.

After running for the White House on a pledge to end the Iraq war and then making good on that promise in late 2011, Obama thrust the U.S. military back into Iraq this month with a limited airstrike campaign against Islamic State targets.

Obama has said he will not send U.S. combat troops to another ground war in the Mideast. But expanding the airstrikes in Iraq and broadening them to include Syria could mean a lengthy American military commitment in the region that could consume much of Obama¡¯s remaining time in office.

¡°What we should have learned over the past dozen years in that part of the world is that the use of military power is very unpredictable,¡± said Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard¡¯s John F. Kennedy School of Government.

That may be particularly true in Syria, where President Bashar Assad¡¯s government is warring with opposition forces. Unlike in Iraq, the battle lines are more clearly drawn. Syria has a host of military players in close proximity to each other, including the Islamic State, the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, mainstream Western-backed rebels and pro-government forces.

The Islamic State is among the groups fighting Assad, meaning a U.S. campaign to weaken the extremists could actually strengthen a leader the White House has sought to push from office.

Obama could try to counteract that uncomfortable dynamic by also taking strikes against Assad, though that could put the U.S. on the hook for the kind of long-term commitment to rebuilding Syria that he has tried to avoid.

The risks are no less troubling if Obama allows the Islamic State to continue having unfettered access to a safe haven in Syria. Politically, it could bolster the argument from his critics that he is overseeing an American retreat on the world stage. It also could give the militants space to strengthen and become a threat not just to U.S. interests in the region, but also to the U.S. at home.

Obama¡¯s own military leadership made clear in recent days that the threat from the Islamic State cannot be fully eliminated without going after the group in Syria, as well as Iraq.

¡°This is an organization that has an apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated,¡± said Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ¡°Can they be defeated without addressing that part of their organization which resides in Syria? The answer is no. That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border.¡±

To White House critics, the unappetizing options are the result of Obama¡¯s own foreign policy missteps. They argue that he gave extremists an opening in Iraq by not doing more to reach an agreement with the Iraqi government to leave U.S. forces in the country after 2011. They say his decision to not provide heavy weaponry to more moderate rebel groups in Syria also helped facilitate the Islamic State¡¯s rise.

Without a course correction, Obama¡¯s critics argue, the U.S. will be at greater risk.

¡°If we do not do more to assist our Iraqi partners and those moderate Syrians who are fighting ISIL and directly target ISIL¡¯s leadership and networks in Iraq and Syria, I fear that James Foley will not be the only American to die at their hands,¡± said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., using one of the acronyms for the Islamic State.

Obama¡¯s advisers say the responsibility for stemming the rise of the Islamic State does not rest solely with the United States. The White House has been imploring Sunni states in the region ? Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates in particular ? to wield their influence with tribal leaders in Iraq and get them to push the Islamic State out of areas they have occupied.

The U.S. also has been discussing ways that allies such as Britain, France, Australia and Canada can become involved through intelligence sharing, military assistance for Kurdish forces in Iraq and moderate opposition forces in Syria, and if necessary, joining the U.S. in military action."

40,"Young North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un¡¯s health is just fine, his government said Thursday evening, so his sister is probably not running the country. It was said Kim Yo Jong had taken over while her brother underwent medical treatment, but So Se Pyong, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told Reuters Kim was not in bad health.

The ambassador sat down for an interview where he discussed a variety of matters, including North Korea's nuclear program, possibly negotiations to free three detained Americans and, of course, Kim¡¯s health.

It has been rumored Kim, 31, might have had ankle surgery, but So said that is incorrect. The story emerged after Kim did not appear at the Supreme People's Assembly last month and reports said he suffered from """"discomfort.¡± He was also seen walking with a limp in July. """"That is rumors, fabricated rumors,"""" So said about Kim's alleged ailment.

Questions about Kim¡¯s health rose after an article from the Diplomat, a magazine based in Tokyo, claimed his sister was making important government decisions while Kim was being treated at Bonghwa Clinic in North Korea's capital Pyongyang.

""""Some say Hwang Byong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo Jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,"""" Kim Heung Gwang, the head of North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity, reportedly said.

Even if So denies any health problems, Kim has not been seen by his people since Sept. 3. The leader also gained a significant amount of weight, which could contribute to ailments like gout, diabetes or high blood pressure, sources told the Associated Press.

41,"Although Apple has given us our first peek at the Apple Watch, so far we don¡¯t know much about it, including when it will be released or how much its many versions will cost.

A new report, however, provides some possible answers to these questions. According to a French website, the Apple Watch will start at around $500 for the steel model. And gold? Gold will be even more expensive.

According to iGen.fr, the stainless steel Apple Watch in polished steel or black will cost $500 when it debuts close to Valentine¡¯s Day of 2015. This would be a $150 premium over the anodized aluminum Sports Model, which Apple said last month would start at a price of $349.

For the gold model, expect to spend 10 times as much. According to iGen.fr¡¯s sources, the gold Apple Watch in yellow or pink gold would cost between $4,000 and $5,000 when it goes on sale in January.

iGen.fr also suggests that the Apple Watch will rank low on the iFixIt repairability scale. They claim the only thing on the Apple Watch that will be user-replaceable is the strap, so don¡¯t expect to be able to repair an Apple Watch the way you would a normal timepiece.

As for shipping date, iGen.fr¡¯s sources say the Apple Watch is still on track for a February 2015 release date. That pink gold Apple Watch is looking like a pretty good Valentine¡¯s Day present right now, isn¡¯t it?"
43,"The small town of Purdon, Texas has been quarantined after a family of five tested positive for the Ebola virus.

Purdon is located just 70 miles from Dallas, Texas, and the hospital that has cared for both American Ebola patients, Thomas Eric Duncan, and Texas nurse, Nina Pham.

It has been verified that Jack Phillips returned from Dallas last week while on business. Shortly after arriving home, Mr. Phillips began exhibiting flu-like symptoms, but did not immediately go to the hospital. At this time his wife and children began showing similar symptoms, which provoked the family to get tested. Doctors then learned that Phillips, his wife, and three children had contracted Ebola haemorrhagic fever.

Facts About Purdon, Texas And The Ebola Quarantine

Unincorporated community in Navarro County

Originally Known As Belle Point

Ebola is spread through contact with bodily fluids of an infected individual

Ebola has a 90% casualty rate in areas such as West Africa. In America the mortality rate is 50/50

Five people are confirmed to have the Ebola Virus in Pardon County

CDC quarantined the area, erecting road blocks and disallowing anyone in or out of the area

A staff member at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital contacted National Report with a short statement about the Ebola situation in Texas. The individual wished to remain anonymous for their own safety, and told us the following,

¡°As far as we know, Jack Phillis had not come in contact with neither the late Thomas Duncan or Mrs. Phan. It is perhaps possible that he was within a close proximity of the infected parties, but it is otherwise unknown as to how Phillips was infected with Ebola.

The CDC wasted no time sealing up the rest of the town¡¯s denizens, and has stopped all traffic entering and exiting Purdon, TX. As of 10 Pm, Oct. 13th area has been surrounded with police and CDC officials. Communications with the locals seems to have been cut off, and press is currently awaiting an official statement from local authorities."
44,"This is the shocking moment a US Marine gets shot in the head by a Taliban sniper ? but is saved by his helmet.

Captured on a helmet-mounted camera, the video shows three Marines during a joint helicopter raid in the Now Zad district, Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in 2013.

Upon hearing gunfire, the team move out to determine where it is coming from.

They travel through a short tunnel and then into another, where they all pause just before exiting.

Without warning, a bullet, presumably from a sniper, cracks against the helmet of one of the soldiers.

¡°We got a sniper,¡± the Marine filming exclaims, before the group rush back to protected area.

Complaining that their ears are ringing, they inspect the helmet which was hit before resolving to find out where the sniper is located.

Warner Bros never confirmed the report and its still unclear whether the vehicle was ever stolen. But Snyder just took to Twitter to make light of the situation, posting a photo of the Gotham City police recovering the Batmobile and arresting the individual responsible. """"Case closed,"""" he wrote.

47,"After campaigning on a promise to reform stop-and-frisk, Mayor Bill de Blasio is set to launch his most significant effort to address the issues raised by the policy. Law-enforcement officials tell the New York Times that soon the NYPD may issue tickets for low-level marijuana possession rather than making arrests. Under the de Blasio administration's planned changes to the city's marijuana policy, those caught with a small amount of weed would be issued a court summons, but avoid a trip to the police station. The shift could have a huge impact in black and Latino communities, as a recent study found those groups represented 86 percent of those arrested for marijuana possession in the city this year.

The de Blasio administration is still working out the details, such as how much weed one could possess without triggering an arrest, and some are already unhappy with the proposed change. Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson, who announced this year that he would stop prosecuting small-scale marijuana possession cases, said that telling people to show up in a court room without arresting them may actually be worse for minorities.

""In order to give the public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system, these cases should be subject to prosecutorial review,"" Thompson explained. ""By allowing these cases to avoid early review, by issuing a summons, there is a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place. These cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred.""

In other words, don't expect the debate about how NYPD officers should proceed when they catch someone with a joint to be resolved anytime soon."
48,"The interwebs was all aflutter today with news that elusive graffiti artist, political activist, film director, painter and long time fugitive that for years has gone by the pseudonymous name of Banksy, was arrested early this morning by London¡¯s Metropolitan Police. According to reports, after hours of questioning and a raid of his London art studio, his true name and identity have finally been revealed. A video was even produced purporting to reveal Banksy¡¯s real identity:



According to reports:

¡°¡¦The City of London Police say Banksy¡¯s real name is Paul Horner, a 35-year old male born in Liverpool, England. London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy and how Horner was finally apprehended after all these years on the run. ¡°We had a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force monitoring different groups where Banksy was known to frequent. We received word that around 2am a group of individuals left a flat speculated to be one of Banky¡¯s art studios. This group was followed by agents and once vandalism had occurred, we then arrested the group, 5 men total. These individuals all had ID on them except for one, and that is the one we believed to be Banksy,¡± Edwards said.¡±

¡°We then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from. Inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism. We also found a passport and ID of a Paul Horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding.¡± Edwards continued, ¡°Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting. We are also holding the other four individuals whose names we are not releasing at this time.¡±

Despite the ¡°if it¡¯s on the internet, it must be true¡± adage, we immediately smelled HOAX, so did a bit of digging (our mascot Fido is good at that).  It didn¡¯t take long (30 seconds in fact), to rule this out as a not-very-elaborate fake.  We reached out to Banksy¡¯s PR agent Jo Brooks, who confirmed the hoax in 3 simple words:

Banksy¡¯s identity was long speculated to be Robin Gunningham, a man born in Bristol, England in 1973. Known for his contempt for the government in labeling graffiti as vandalism, Banksy displays his art on public walls and even goes as far as to build physical prop pieces. He does not sell his work directly; however, art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder.

So we can all breath a big sigh of relief¡¦ inhale, exhale¡¦ Banksy is still a mystery. Someone. Somewhere. Phew."

A Kansas City TV station, KCTV-5 reported Saturday night someone was being quarantined at Rockhill Research Hospital (Research Medical Center), according to their sister station in Wichita, KWCH.

A source in Kansas City confirmed the story to the Gateway Pundit and added some details.

A Nigerian woman was taken to the hospital with a high fever and Ebola like symptoms. Her apartment building was quarantined, though that may have been lifted later.

The source added the Nigerian woman initially tested negative for Ebola and was released (or set to be released) but was called back to the hospital. The source said parts of the hospital may be quarantined but the hospital is not confirming anything.

When it comes to promoting equality of the sexes, we tend to think that we¡¯ve come a long way in the past 40 years.

But a letter that is believed to have been included in a 1974 Lego box set appears to show that the much-loved Danish toy company started to get there a good while before everyone else.

According to a post on the online community platform reddit.com, Lego sent a message addressed ¡°To parents¡± inside the box of assorted building blocks, explaining how ¡°the urge to create is equally strong in all children¡¦ boys and girls¡±.

It¡¯s a powerful sentiment that has seen the image shared widely since user fryd_ first posted it on Saturday morning.

He said that he came across the letter while playing ¡°with his niece and nephew at their Grandma¡¯s house¡±, and that it was in a set ¡°from 1973 with a blonde girl on the front with a white Lego house¡±.

Here is the letter in full:

¡°To Parents

¡°The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls.

¡°It¡¯s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship.

¡°A lot of boys like dolls houses. They¡¯re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They¡¯re more exciting than dolls houses.

¡°The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.¡±

While the image appears to include a copyright from 1974 and the name of a printer in Hamburg used by Lego at the time, the authenticity of the letter could not be independently verified, and a spokesperson for Lego was not immediately available for comment.

User fryd_ commented that ¡°it seems like we¡¯ve taken a step backwards¡± since the letter was written. But others disagreed ? with Taliesen13 responding: ¡°That sounds like the moral of The Lego Movie.¡±"
54,"A nun living in an Italian convent has given birth to a surprise baby after complaining of stomach pains, according to the Italian press.

The nun, who came to Italy from South America, belonged to an order called the Missionary Sisters of the Love of Christ in Macerata, located in the Italian region of Le Marche.

She says she had no idea she was pregnant.

She was taken to hospital by her sisters, where doctors quickly told her she was pregnant, according to Italian newspaper Il Corriere Adriatico.

The baby is healthy and the nun¡¯s convent has expressed an interest in taking care of him.

The nun arrived at the convent in June, when it is now believed she was already pregnant.

According to the Italian newspaper L¡¯Unione Sarda, the convent said the woman """"is not a nun, is a girl that we are helping¡± possibly because she had not yet taken her vows.

The woman, who is reported to be from Bolivia, has now been discharged from hospital."
55,"FEARS have been raised that Islamic militants have seized a dozen commercial aircraft in an attack on a Libyan airport last week. Now, according to a report, intelligence agencies are warning the jets could be used in 9/11-style attacks.

¡°There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,¡± one official told The Washington Free Beacon this morning.

¡°We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.¡±

The report said intelligence reports distributed within the US government over the past few weeks have detailed the types of aircraft believed seized. Several have the size and range to reach deep into Europe and Africa.

The Beacon reports the analysts as issuing a specific warning ? that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack on the date marking the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon in the United States.

It is also the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi.

The threat warning comes as dramatic video reveals the final moments of a Libyan combat jet.

The aircraft plunged into the ground less than a kilometre from the country¡¯s parliament during a fly-past intended to honour the pilot of another fighter jet that died in a crash a week ago.

The resulting fireball damaged several nearby buildings.

Libya is witnessing its worst violence since former dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi was toppled and killed in 2011.

The country¡¯s divisions are deeply rooted in rivalries between Islamists and non-Islamists, as well as powerful tribal and regional allegiances between groups that quickly filled the power vacuum after Gaddafi¡¯s was ousted. Successive transitional governments have failed to control the militias.

FIGHTING FLARES UP

Fierce clashes have erupted in recent days over Libya¡¯s eastern city of Benghazi.

Fighting between Islamist militiamen and rival forces loyal to a renegade general killed 31 fighters on both sides, a security official said overnight.

The fighting erupted late on Monday, with forces and fighter jets belonging to General Khalifa Hifter pounding positions of Islamist militias called The Benghazi Revolutionary Shura Council, said the official.

The issue of foreign military intervention is one of the most debated in the country. Earlier this month, unknown parties carried out air strikes in Tripoli, bombing Islamist-allied militias¡¯ positions. American officials confirmed reports that Egypt and the United Arab Emirates were behind the two air strikes.

The hours-long clashes concentrated around the city¡¯s Benina airport and the militiamen responded with artillery, added the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media.

Hifter¡¯s side lost 20 fighters while the militiamen had 11 killed, and 36 fighters in all were wounded, the official said. Several of the wounded were reported to be in critical condition.

Fighting in recent months has mostly engulfed the capital, Tripoli, and also Benghazi, the country¡¯s second-largest city.

The militias in control of the capital, operating under an umbrella group called the Dawn of Libya, have also taken control of the US embassy compound a week after they drove out rival militias.

On Tuesday, Libya¡¯s official news agency said calm had returned to Tripoli, with some banks resuming work and shops and bakeries reopening. Traffic also picked up in the capital and there were long lines outside gas stations. Some families who fled the fighting areas have returned to their homes, the agency said.

POLITICAL CRISIS

On Monday, Libya¡¯s newly elected parliament asked Abdullah al-Thinni ? the country¡¯s prime minister who resigned last week ? to form a new government. Al-Thinni had said after his resignation that his government had lost control of almost all state institutions and government offices to the armed Islamist militias.

The fighting forced the newly elected parliament and al-Thinni to operate in the eastern city of Tobruk.

On Tuesday, Mohammed Shouaib, the deputy head of parliament, stressed that the body did not ask for ¡°military intervention¡± but for the United Nations to help Libya build its institutions, including the police and military. He was referring to an earlier decision by the parliament to call for international help in restoring order in Libya.

Shouaib was speaking in a press conference with British envoy Jonathan Powell and British ambassador Michael Aron, who were visiting Tobruk to express support to the elected parliament.

Meanwhile in Tripoli, a parallel government is in the making. Supported by Islamist allies, the so-called National Salvation government led by Omar al-Hassi and his 14-ministers won a vote of confidence. Al-Hassi was appointed by the outgoing parliament ? whose mandate expired after a new parliament was elected ? and assigned him to form a new government to challenge the legitimate ones in Tobruk."
56,"A man accused of attempting to rape a girl in India has been left in a critical condition after locals cut off his genitals as punishment.

The group took the law into their own hands after they found a 40-year old man pinning a young girl to the wall in the north-eastern city of Ganganagar.

After a community meeting, the vigilantes dragged the man into a nearby butchery and used a meat cleaver to cut off his penis. The remains were discarded in the street beside the man, who was suffering from severe blood loss.

One local said: """"No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime,"""" the Daily Mirror reports.

""""We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it's time it stopped.""""


She said it would """"send out a very strong message"""" to possible offenders, warning them of the punishment they face.

Police were quick to condemn the attack, warning locals not to take the law into their own hands and calling for those responsible to hand themselves in.

""""As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice.""""

The young girl was treated for shock and is receiving counselling, while the man remains in a critical condition in hospital.

Incidents of rape in India have gone up tenfold in the last 40 years, The Guardian reports, with a spate of recent attacks shocking the nation and the world. Last year a 23-year old woman died after being gang raped on a bus in the Indian capital. ¡¤"
59,"This is the moment a group of Russians captured video footage of what they believed was a Yeti walking through the woods.

The footage shows a 'bear-like' figure covered in hair emerging from an area of snow-covered trees in the south-western Adygeya Republic before disappearing again seconds later.

A team had set out in search of the mysterious creature after local television reported that it had been sighted in a remote region an hour's drive away from the city of Adygeisk.

Sighting: A team of Russians believe they have captured footage of the elusive Yeti in a remote patch of woodland

Footage shows a 'bear-like' figure covered in hair emerging from an area of snow-covered trees in the south-western Adygeya Republic before disappearing again seconds later

They said they had questioned residents at a mountainside lodge who claimed to have seen it - and on speaking to others in the area managed to secure reports of several independent sightings.

The group claim they heard the crunching of snow as they headed out to investigate before capturing footage of the creature, which they describe as covered in hair.

Afterwards, they took a plaster cast of a large footprint they said they found in the snow.

Eyewitness Ludmila Hristoforova who spoke to local television said: 'The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we've seen something big and shaggy.'

Homeowner Andrei Kazarian said: 'I heard footsteps and we were pretty sure there was no one else around because we knew for sure everyone else was inside the house.

'Although we didn't see anyone we saw its huge footprints. They were five to six centimetres deep and couldn't come from a human foot.

Big foot? Some have suggested the video was just a stunt to bring in tourists while others are convinced this was the first proof that the yeti exists in the area

'We took a plaster cast of them and we estimate that it probably would have taken about 200 kilos to press the snow down that much.'

The plaster cast and the footage have now been handed to local scientists and will go to the local council by the end of the month.

The footage has already sparked debate with some suggesting it was just a stunt to bring in tourists and others convinced this was the first proof that the yeti exists in the area."
60,"The White House is attempting to verify footage released by the Islamic State (IS) purporting to show the killing of an American journalist in retaliation for ongoing US airstrikes against its forces in Iraq.

The video circulated on Tuesday showed a masked Isis fighter beheading a kneeling man cloaked in an orange jumpsuit who is purported to be James Foley, a photojournalist who went missing in Syria in 2012. The White House said it was working to establish the video's authenticity, but if it was genuine, the US would be ¡°appalled by the brutal murder¡±.

Foley has worked in a number of conflict zones in the Middle East, including Syria, Libya and Iraq. He and another journalist were working in the northern province of Idlib in Syria when they were kidnapped in November 2012 near the village of Taftanaz.

The video opened with a clip of US President Barack Obama saying he had authorised strikes in Iraq. ¡°Obama authorises military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims,¡± words appear in English and Arabic on the screen. It showed black and white aerial footage of air strikes with text saying ¡°American aggression against the Islamic State¡±

A person identified as James Foley and wearing an orange outfit is seen kneeling in the desert as a man in black dress with a black mask stands beside him, holding a knife. ¡°I call on my friends family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the US government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality,¡± the kneeling man says.

The man in the mask says: ¡°This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen, of your country. As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards the Islamic State. Today your military air force is attacking us daily in Iraq. Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims. You are no longer fighting an insurgency. We are an Islamic army, and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide.¡±

Following his statement he beheads the kneeling man.

The video also shows a second man on his knees, who is named as Steven Sotloff, another American journalist, who was kidnapped in Syria in August 2013. After bringing out Sotloff, the masked executioner addresses the US President directly, saying: ¡°The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.¡±

The Islamic State had not previously executed American citizens publicly. The video was posted after the United States resumed air strikes in Iraq for the first time since the end of the US occupation in 2011. A Twitter account set up by Mr Foley¡¯s family to help find him said early on Wednesday: ¡°We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.¡±"
61,"NORTH Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in firm control of his government but has hurt his leg, a source with access to North Korea¡¯s leadership said yesterday, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old¡¯s health and grip on power.

North Korea¡¯s state media, which usually chronicles Kim¡¯s whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on September 3.

The source said that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises.

¡°He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part, too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon,¡± the source said on condition of anonymity.

¡°He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened.¡±

Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury.

Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source.

¡°Kim Jong Un is in total control,¡± added the source, who has close ties to Pyongyang.

North Korean officials have denied that Kim¡¯s public absence is health-related and a United States official following North Korea said this week there were no indications that he was seriously ill or in political trouble. It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view.

In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days.

He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium.

Speculation that Kim¡¯s unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a TV report late last month that said he was suffering from ¡°discomfort.¡±

Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit last Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.

The source with knowledge of Kim¡¯s health said rumors of a coup were ¡°rubbish.¡±

Kim was absent from a September 25 meeting of the Supreme People¡¯s Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago.

However, Kim¡¯s name has not disappeared from state propaganda. Yesterday¡¯s edition of the Workers¡¯ Party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page."
62,"Nigeria says it has struck a cease-fire deal with Boko Haram, raising hopes that over 200 schoolgirls who were kidnapped by the militant group will be released. But mystery continues to surround the identity of the interlocutor on the other side of the negotiations.

Nigerian officials said the deal was reached in Chad on Friday in talks with a Saudi Arabia-based Boko Haram representative named Danladi Ahmadu.

The name took many by surprise, including people who have been involved in previous negotiations with Boko Haram. ¡°I have failed to find anyone who has ever heard of him,¡± BBC¡¯s Nigeria correspondent wrote.   ¡°We've tried verifying the authenticity of the person from sources traditionally close to Boko Haram militants and we are getting negative feedback,¡± the editors of Nigerian news site Sahara Reporters told The WorldPost by email.

Ahmad Salkida, a Nigerian journalist who is considered close to Boko Haram's leaders, said he does not believe Ahmadu is part of the group¡¯s leadership or that he speaks for the group. ¡°I challenge Danladi Ahmadu to an open debate if he has d [sic] interest of Nigeria at heart. Who is he?"""" Salkida wrote on Twitter.

But Mike Omeri, the Nigerian government's spokesperson on the Boko Haram insurgency, told The WorldPost Saturday that the government is confident it has been negotiating with the right guy.

¡°These talks did not just happen one sunny morning ... They approached the president of Chad, and if he wasn¡¯t confident [of Ahmadu¡¯s identity] he wouldn¡¯t have connected him with the president of Nigeria,¡± Omeri said. """"The fact that this contact comes from Nigeria¡¯s neighbor gives us confidence.""""

Chad has confirmed it is acting as a mediator in the talks to free the girls, who were kidnapped in the Nigerian village of Chibok in April. Since Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan visited Chad last month, rumors have grown that Nigeria's government was quietly negotiating the girls' release via its neighbor. It was not immediately clear how long the talks have been taking place.

Boko Haram's leadership has not commented on the cease-fire. Meanwhile, Ahmadu himself has purportedly made at least two statements in recent days. On Friday, he gave an interview with Voice of America¡¯s Hausa-language service in which he didn¡¯t mention the kidnapped schoolgirls and was vague on the details of the cease-fire, Agence France-Presse reported. The news agency also noted that Ahmadu referred to the militant group as Boko Haram, a name used by outsiders but not by the insurgents themselves.

On Saturday, Sahara Reporters said its correspondent in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri had obtained a CD recording of another statement by Ahamdu. This time, he was more precise.

¡°On the girls that we took from Chibok, all that we want before we free the girls is to get justice from the Nigerian state because there are many of our members that their business premises were destroyed, some killed and others in detention and many other oppression,¡± Ahmadu said, according to a translation from Hausa by Sahara Reporters. The news site¡¯s editors said they remain skeptical about his identity.

As part of the deal, Omeri said, the talks taking place in Chad this week will address the release of the schoolgirls.

Omeri added that the militants are motivated by a wish to reintegrate into society. ¡°They are working towards peace in order to have a chance for them to return to normal things -- for example, many have businesses, """" he said.

Asked whether Nigeria would consider releasing captured Boko Haram militants in exchange for the girls, Omeri said ¡°every asset"""" will be directed towards the girls' release. """"Everything possible is being done until the day they are freed,"""" he said.

""""Boko Haram want peace, they are ready for it and intend to have it implemented,"""" he added.

After the cease-fire was announced, suspected Boko Haram militants continued to attack communities in northeast Nigeria, leaving several dozen dead over the weekend.

But Omeri insisted that the violence would not deter the negotiations. He suggested that militants in remote areas may not have heard about the cease-fire, or that the attacks could have been perpetrated by criminal opportunists, rather than Boko Haram members.

Boko Haram is """"deeply fractured,"""" according to the risk consultancy Stratfor, quoted in Reuters Sunday. Nigeria's government had a """"difficult time identifying a Boko Haram representative who could make compromises and guarantee the entire group will observe them,"""" Stratfor said.

""""It is quite possible that Abuja has reached an agreement with a legitimate representative of a specific cell ... that holds the kidnapped schoolgirls captive,"""" the group added.

In the kidnapped girls¡¯ hometown, the community hardly dared to hope that the girls might be finally returned. """"We don't know how true it is until we prove it,"""" said Bana Lawan, chairman of Chibok Local Government Area, told The Associated Press."
63,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had surgery in Pyongyang in mid-September to treat fractures to both ankles and remains in hospital, a source claimed Monday.

The source, who recently visited the North, said, """"I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended."""" 

The source added Kim had surgery at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members, in mid-September and is now recovering there. 

The source said bodyguards have been posted around the ward and security remains tight. """"There's been a marked increase in the number of elite officials visiting the ward,"""" the source added. 

One intelligence official here said Kim's official car does not appear to have left Pyongyang, so it is likely he remains in the capital. 

The official said Kim is overweight and appears to have sprained his ankles during a grueling tour of military bases and factories in Cuban heels. Kim is around 170 cm tall and has become noticeably overweight since he came to power.
There has been speculation that his obesity and binge drinking brought on gout. The official Rodong Sinmun daily recently said Kim """"labored on"""" by visiting various facilities braving the hot summer weather. 

Kim missed a regular session of the Supreme People's Assembly in Pyongyang on Thursday. 

A government official here said, """"It's unlikely that a young man like Kim Jong-un would have missed the Supreme People's Assembly just because he has gout.""""

State TV in a rare admission on Thursday showed footage of Kim limping and admitted he is ill. South Korean intelligence also learned that a team of doctors from Europe recently went to North Korea."

This means the end of the Big Mac, apple pie and large size menu items. Currently, the Big Mac has a whopping 550 calories and 29g of fat. The Apple pie contains 250 cal, and it would take a full 69 minute to walk that off! With that being said, those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination.

McDonald¡¯s is currently testing out a new version of their slim down menu in Delaware, Little Rock, Waco, Bakersfield, Macon and Knoxville. They plan a full nationwide rollout beginning February 1, 2015.

One notable ¡°ingredient¡± ? preservatives ? might also be eliminated from the menu altogether. Mark Andr?s, President of McDonald¡¯s USA, sparked widespread speculation when he asked investors, ¡°Why do we need to have preservatives in our food?¡± And then answered himself with a ¡°We probably don¡¯t.¡±

What do you think about this new menu transformation at McDonald¡¯s? In an attempt to make America healthier, do you think it will work?"

In the state of Colorado, marijuana dispensaries are big business ? earning some retailers nearly $1 million per year.

Those numbers were so appealing to the KFC Corporation, they decided to incorporate a marijuana dispensary with their Colorado franchise restaurants.

Franchisees have the opportunity to expand into the business for an additional $35,000 setup fee.

Less than two weeks after Leonardo DiCaprio broke off talks with Sony to play Steve Jobs, the studio has set its sights back on Christian Bale.

Sources say Sony is beginning negotiations with The Fighter actor, who was originally eyed to play the late Apple Computer co-founder back when David Fincher was in talks to direct. The move comes after Bale's negotiations with Fox to star in The Deep Blue Goodbye hit a roadblock. Sources say Fox was trying to include sequel options for Bale to tackle the lead role of Detective Travis McGee in what is hoped to be a franchise starter, but the actor balked. Now, talks are ongoing with Bale without sequel options, but even if a deal is reached, the actor would shoot the Jobs project before Deep Blue Goodbye.

Danny Boyle is directing the untitled Jobs film, which is based on Walter Isaacson's book and adapted by Aaron Sorkin and is one of the most anticipated biopics in recent years. Sony optioned the best-seller in 2011, around the time of Jobs' death.

74,"At least one of five Taliban militants released by the Obama administration in a controversial exchange for American soldier Bowe Bergdahl has ""attempted to reestablish contacts"" with the Taliban in Afghanistan, U.S. officials told NBC News on Thursday.

There was no indication the former prisoner, being held in Qatar, made contact with the Taliban. The officials said it is unclear whether this was an actual attempt to rejoin the Taliban militants in Afghanistan.

""We're closely monitoring the situation and see no potential threat"" from the attempted communication, a senior U.S. official said. The official could not say exactly how the former prisoner tried to reach the Taliban.

The five Taliban militants, including two top leaders, were released from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in May. As part of the deal that led to Bergdahl's release, they had to remain in Qatar under a one-year travel ban set to end in June.

The militant who tried to reconnect with the Taliban had ""several phone calls"" with family members in Afghanistan, a senior official told NBC. There was no indication the calls, monitored by security officials, involved any ""threatening activity or planning,"" the official added.

Nevertheless, the U.S. will try to have restrictions placed on out-of-country calls though the prisoners are allowed to communicate with relatives and other visitors in Qatar.

Bergdahl was reportedly captured by the Haqqani terrorist network in Pakistan after he left a remote outpost in June 2009 and held for five years. Bergdahl could be charged with desertion."
75,"HBO is in talks with Apple over a partnership that would see its upcoming standalone web-only subscription television package available on the Apple TV, reports Michael Learmonth, writing for International Business Times. CNBC has also confirmed that Apple and HBO are in talks in the video tweet posted below.

BREAKING: Sources tell @JBoorstin that Apple & HBO are in talks for Apple TV to be a launch partner for 'HBO Now'. https://t.co/hQd9AzA3Xr??CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) March 4, 2015
Apple could potentially be one of HBO's launch partners for its web-only service, which may be called ""HBO Now."" News of HBO's web-based subscription service first surfaced in October of 2014, after HBO CEO Richard Plepler shared the company's plans at an investor presentation.

The service, aimed at cable cutters, will allow users to access HBO content without a cable subscription for a set monthly fee. With the launch of a cable-free subscription service, HBO will become the first major premium content provider to cease limiting its television and movie offerings to cable subscribers.

According to Learmonth, HBO's web-only subscription will launch in April alongside the premiere of the fifth season of Game of Thrones, which takes place on April 12. The service is said to cost $15 per month, which is roughly how much it costs to subscribe to HBO through a cable company. A partnership with Apple would allow the service to be watched on the Apple TV, much like the existing version of HBO's service, HBO Go. HBO Go is available to all existing HBO subscribers on a variety of devices like the iPad and Apple TV, but it requires an HBO subscription through a cable or satellite provider.

Cable companies like Time Warner and Comcast have long been reluctant to offer piecemeal pricing and companies like HBO have previously avoided moving away from traditional cable models in order to preserve the status quo and avoid upsetting existing revenue streams.

The introduction of HBO's service will be a major victory for cord cutters, and it could encourage other content providers to introduce similar offerings. Content providers' reluctance to shift away from traditional cable pricing models has been one of the major factors that's prevented Apple from establishing deals for its own service in the past.

The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly said that the assertion that ISIS-affiliated terrorists were arrested while crossing the U.S.-Mexico border is ¡°categorically false and not supported by any credible intelligence or facts on the ground.¡±

But the vice president of the largest union representing Border Patrol agents told BuzzFeed News on Thursday that DHS ? which oversees the Border Patrol ? is incorrect. And he said, the incident highlights the need for more funding for the Border Patrol,

¡°I haven¡¯t been able to outright confirm that it happened, but from what I have heard it sounds very credible,¡± said Shawn Moran, the vice-president of the National Border Patrol Council, which represents some 17,000 Border Patrol employees, ¡°From what people have read to me, from what they say they have seen in documents, it seems pretty legit.¡±

Moran admitted he had not seen the document himself. He added that he did not know the name of the official who prepared the report, or what agency did that official work for, but that his ¡°instincts told¡± him the official was with the Border Patrol. He also declined to tell BuzzFeed News who had told him about the report in the first place.

When asked what would be the appropriate response to the alleged incident, Moran said that the Border Patrol needs more funding and more people to do its job and prevent ISIS from entering the U.S. again.

A spokeswoman with the Department of Homeland Security declined to discuss Moran¡¯s specific statements, but insisted that ¡°DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.¡±

Moran¡¯s statements Thursday followed allegations from two Republican lawmakers who told BuzzFeed News on Wednesday that suspected terrorists have infiltrated the U.S.?Mexico border and as many as 10 fighters have been captured.

The persistence of these rumors may stem from the arrests in September of four people with suspected ties to terrorism that were later found to be unfounded, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said in a speech Thursday.

¡°Four individuals were arrested, their supposed link to terrorism was thoroughly investigated and checked, and in the end amounted a claim by the individuals themselves that they were members of the Kurdish Worker¡¯s Party ? an organization that is actually fighting against ISIL and defended Kurdish territory in Iraq,¡± said Johnson. ¡°Nevertheless, these individuals have been arrested for unlawful entry, they are detained, and they will be deported.¡±

Reports that terrorists affiliated with Islamist groups have tried to enter the United States through the southern border have circulated around the web for months, even before ISIS became a household term.

In July, for example, members of a volunteer armed militia told Breitbart News they were concerned because they had found what they thought was a ¡°Muslim Prayer Rug¡± in the Arizona desert.

Thus far, the threat embodied by that alleged rug has failed to materialize."
77,"Ahmed Abdi Godane is the spiritual leader of al-Shabab

He is believed among six people killed in a U.S. airstrike on two cars near the al-Shabab stronghold of Barawe

Godane is believed to have ordered the Westgate Mall massacre in Kenya in September 2013 that killed 67 people

U.S. officials have not yet confirmed Godane is among the dead

U.S. drone strikes are believed to have killed the leader of the Somali terrorist group al-Shabab, who ordered the massacre at a Kenyan shopping mall last year that killed 67 people.

U.S. Intelligence officials believe Ahmed Abdi Godane was traveling in a two-car convoy Monday night near al-Shabab's main base in Barawe when American drone aircraft hit the vehicles with missiles.

Six people were killed in the attack and Somali authorities say they think Godane is among the dead - though the Pentagon said it is still awaiting confirmation.

Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, is al-Shabab's spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al-Qaida and became the most high-profile terrorist group in Africa.

Ahmed Abdi Godane is believed one of six people killed when a drone fired on his two-car convoy in Somalia on Monday night, though U.S. officials have not confirmed the death

Dangerous as ever: Even though al-Shabab fighters have been kicked out of the capital of Mogadishu, they have continued attacking targets throughout Africa

Under Godane's orders, the group attacked the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing at least 67 people a year ago this month.

The group was also responsible for a suicide bombing at a World Cup watching party in Kampala, Uganda, in 2010 that left 74 dead and 70 injured.

The U.S. has targeted planners of the bloody Westgate assault, in which four Britons and two Canadians were killed. A month after the attack, Navy SEALs landed at al-Shabab's headquarters in Barawe and attempted to capture another mastermind behind the attack.

In 2012, the U.S. government put a $7million price on Godane's head - though he has escaped justice until now.

A witness to Monday's airstrike in Somalia described ground-shaking explosions caused by the missile. Somali government and African Union forces heading to a town in the district heard what sounded like an 'earthquake' as the al-Shabab bases were hit, the governor of Somalia's Lower Shabelle region, Abdiqadir Mohamed Nor, told The Associated Press.

'There was an airstrike near Sablale. We saw something,' Nor said.

U.S. commanders said they are waiting to determine the outcome of Monday's attack.

'U.S. military forces conducted an operation in Somalia today against the al-Shabab network. We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information as and when appropriate,' said Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby.

After the U.S. strike in a forest near Sablale district south of Mogadishu, masked Islamic militants in the area arrested dozens of residents they suspected of spying for the U.S. and searched nearby homes, a resident said.

Godane is believed to have ordered the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi, Kenya, last year that claimed 67 lives in Kenya. He also forged the groups alliance with al-Qaeda

'Mass arrests just started, everyone is being detained,' said Mohamed Ali, who lives in Sablale district. 'They even searched nearby jungles and stopped the nomads transporting milk and grass to the towns for questioning.'

The U.S. has carried out several airstrikes in Somalia in recent years.

A U.S. missile strike in January killed a high-ranking intelligence officer for al-Shabab and last October a vehicle carrying senior members of the group was hit in a U.S. strike that killed al-Shabab's top explosives expert.

The latest U.S. action comes after Somalia's government forces regained control of a high-security prison in the capital that was attacked on Sunday. Seven heavily armed suspected al-Shabab members had attempted to free other extremists held there.

Somali officials said all seven attackers, three government soldiers and two civilians were killed. Mogadishu's Godka Jilacow prison is an interrogation center for Somalia's intelligence agency, and many suspected militants are believed to be held in underground cells there. The attack started when a suicide car bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the gate of the prison and the gunmen then fought their way into the prison.

Al-Shabab attacked the mall in Nairobi last year to punish Kenya for sending troops into Somalia against the extremists. Godane said at the time that the mall attack was carried out in retaliation for the West's support for Kenya's Somalia intervention and the 'interest of their oil companies.'

Al Shabab is now mostly active in Somalia's rural regions after being ousted from the capital by African Union forces in 2011.

Somali military officials last week launched a military operation to oust al-Shabab from its last remaining bases in the southern parts of Somalia. On Saturday the militants withdrew from the town of Bulomarer, located about 110 kilometers (70 miles) south of Mogadishu, after hours of fighting."

Pope Francis, talking to a distraught boy whose pet had died, declared there was a place in heaven for the creatures we share our lives with. His comment was reported this week by many news media outside Italy, with dozens of articles in the United States. It was veritable catnip to social media.

However, it turned out the pope had not made the comment.

The news stories were apparently based on a misreading of remarks Pope Francis made at his weekly general audience at the Vatican on Nov. 26 and on a comment that a past pope did make several decades ago.

Pope Paul VI, who died in 1978, once said, reportedly while comforting a child whose dog had died, ""one day we will see our animals in the eternity of Christ.""

""There is a fundamental rule in journalism. That is double-checking, and in this case it was not done,"" the Vatican's deputy spokesman, Father Ciro Benedettini, said on Saturday, when asked about how the media ran with the story.

The spokesman said he received a number of calls on the story from outside Italy on Friday and was taken by surprise because he did not recall the pope saying anything like that.

Religion News Service was among the first media to set the record straight. It said in an article published late on Friday that the error appeared to have stemmed from a piece in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on Nov. 27, whose headline was misleading.


The article recounted the pope's words from his general audience on Nov. 26, when the topic was the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth. It cited the remark about animals and attributed it to Paul VI, but its headline said ""The pope and animals. 'paradise is open to all creatures.'""

The New York Times, which ran a story on Thursday about the purported comment by Francis, acknowledged its mistake, saying in a correction on Friday that it had misattributed the remark by Paul VI to the current pope.

Asked about the mistake, a spokeswoman for the Times quoted Michael Slackman, managing editor of international news, as saying, ""The correction in The Times notes that the specific content and wording were wrong in the article. However, the pope did in fact make comments suggesting heaven is open to animals.""

In his Nov. 26 remarks, the pope referred to heaven saying ""the Sacred Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this marvelous plan cannot but affect all that which surrounds us and which emerged from the thought and the heart of God."" He did not refer specifically to animals in his remarks.

On its website, CNN also corrected its story, noting the misattribution and saying it was unclear what Francis believes about pets going to heaven. A spokeswoman for CNN had no immediate comment.

Reuters did not publish a story on the remarks erroneously attributed to Francis.

WHAT DOES THE POPE THINK ABOUT PETS?

As for what Francis does think about animals, he has not spoken much about them in public, but Benedettini said that from the general tone of his speeches and gestures ""it is clear that he is in spiritual harmony with all of creation.""

The spokesman said the pope was preparing an encyclical that will deal in part with the environment and recalled that a group that looks after stray dogs once brought the animals to his general audience and the pope was pleased.

When he made a Christmas season visit to a Rome parish last year, Francis willingly let a young girl place a lamb on his shoulders as a shepherd would carry it. The pope once told priests that a good pastor should know not only the names of his parishioners but also the names of their dogs, Benedettini said.

Recent popes have said different things about the possible spiritual side of animals.

In 1990, Pope John Paul implied that animals had souls because they too were created from the breath of God. In 2008, former Pope Benedict upset some animal lovers when he said only humans were ""called to eternity.""

¡°I feel happy and relieved. And excited. And really interested to see what¡¯s in this box,¡± she said Thursday night, after posing for a selfie with the capsule for her mom. The extrication took more than seven hours and involved about a dozen workers.


The original contents of the time capsule were first placed in 1795 by Governor Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, and William Scollay in a ceremony that started in downtown Boston and proceeded to the State House, according to historical accounts. It was unearthed during emergency repairs to the foundation in 1855 and then buried again, and had not seen daylight until it emerged on Thursday.

¡°Hopefully there will be no damage and we will be able to observe the artifacts that trace us back to the history not only just of this building, but of our Commonwealth and our country,¡± said Secretary of State William Galvin, who was on hand for the capsule¡¯s first appearance in more than 150 years.

The capsule is believed to include a collection of silver and copper coins dating from between 1652 and 1855; an engraved silver plate; newspapers; the seal of the Commonwealth; cards; and a title page from the Massachusetts Colony Records, according to Meghan Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Administration and Finance.

 Mass. time capsule contents include 350-year-old shilling

Hatchfield, who is head of Objects Conservation at the Museum of Fine Arts, said the corroded copper alloy box that holds the collection was undamaged by the removal process, and appeared to be in good shape. It was a little smaller than a cigar box and, she said, heavier than she expected.

The box was taken by State Police escort to the Museum of Fine Arts, where Hatchfield said it will be X-rayed to determine the contents. There was some concern, Galvin said, that there may be some damage to some of the coins, which may have been washed in acid before the box was reburied in 1855.

¡°It will be opened probably sometime next week,¡± said Galvin. The contents will be examined, he said, but the time capsule will not remain unburied. ¡°Ultimately it will be put back in the box and ultimately back in the stone.¡±

Galvin said officials have not yet decided whether they will add any objects to the capsule before re-burying it. The capsule was discovered during the course of a water infiltration investigation at the State House, which identified the corner where it was hidden as an area of concern.

It is believed to be one of the oldest time capsules in the state, according to Kelly. In October, a century-old time capsule was opened after it was removed from its perch in the head of a golden lion statue that had sat atop the Old State House in downtown Boston. Its contents included sealed letters, photographs, and newspaper articles in near-perfect condition.

On Thursday, excavation of the State House time capsule began at about 9 a.m., with workers unwedging the stone block from the corner of the building and propping it up on blocks of wood so Hatchfield could slide underneath. The block was not flipped upside down, said Hatchfield, because she did not want to risk dislodging any of the contents.

From about 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Hatchfield tapped away at the block, taking periodic breaks to warm up away from the whipping wind and snow. Workers brought her a space heater. The plaster that sealed the box in, she said, was much harder than she anticipated.

As she worked, tiny coins fell out of the plaster. During the 1855 reburial, public officials threw the coins in for good luck. Michael Comeau, executive director of the State Archives, said they appeared to be silver.

As the day wore on, Hatchfield used a small circular saw and a drill to try to free the capsule, and several times, she appeared to think she was close, only to have the box remain stuck. It was the most physically challenging conservation job she has ever done, she said.

¡°I have been privileged to spend all of my working life handling incredibly precious and important objects, and it is very exciting every single time,¡± said Hatchfield. ¡°The sense of continuation of history that you get by entering a museum or historic site, but also by having it in your hands, is incredibly rewarding and enriching. And it gives meaning to a lot of people.¡±"
89,"EXTREMISTS fighting for the Islamic State (IS) have started launching bombs packed with live SCORPIONS.

Bomb canisters ? packed with the venemous arachnids ? are being blasted into towns and villages to scatter scorpions and incite panic, a British military expert has revealed.

Former head of chemical and biological weapons for NATO and the British army Hamish de Bretton-Gordon described the arachnid attacks as """"madness"""".

He told The Daily Mirror: """"It¡¯s madness.

""""IS have improvised devices to launch them.

""""They promote the fact that they are doing it and it creates panic.

""""Scorpions are robust ? even if they are launched a couple of miles, when the canister breaks thousands are flung out and start crawling all around.""""

The 24in scorpion bombs are not used for mass casualties but instead designed to maximise the terrorist group's """"psychological impact"""" on the villagers.

Mr Bretton-Gordon, who returned from Baghdad last week where he had been advising security forces, added: """"The main thing is creating fear.""""

Senior officials in Iraq have reported scorpions being used against civilian targets in northern parts of the country.

There are 25 known species of scorpion with venom capable of killing a human being.

References to 'scorpion bombs' have been found dating back to 198 AD.

The bizarre biological weapon was created when Iraqis began pouring scorpions into ceramic pots to hurl at the Roman armies storming the fortress city of Hatra.

The scorpion-filled weapons have even been credited by some with ending the 20 day siege on the desert city.

91,"The dedicated pet owner initially refused to pay for the procedure to save the 3-inch fish at Toll Barn Veterinary Center in Norfolk, but quickly changed his mind.

A British man forked out $460 to save the life of his goldfish ? after it became constipated.

The dedicated owner took his blocked-up 3-inch pet to a vet after realizing it was struggling to pass waste, reports the Norfolk Daily Eastern Press.

He was stunned to be told that the delicate operation needed to solve the problem would cost $460.

Shocked at the high cost, he initially refused to give Toll Barn Veterinary Center in Norfolk the go-ahead.

But the man, who has not been named, had a change of heart and returned just 10 minutes later to give them the green light.

Vet Faye Bethell administered anesthetic to the fish, which was believed to be 2-years and 10-months old.

The 29-year-old then used a tiny scalpel to remove a lump which had grown close to its dorsal fin. After 50-minutes, the fish was handed back to his grateful owner.

""""I have never done a procedure like that on a goldfish, although I have done it before on more valuable fish like a carp,"""" Bethell told the Norfolk Daily Eastern Press.

""""There was nothing special about the fish. He just liked it a lot. People love their pets ? but that was an expensive little goldfish,"""" she added."
93,"A Chinese woman spent an entire week in a KFC eating fried chicken wings after being dumped by her boyfriend because she ¡®needed time to think¡¯.

Lovesick Tan Shen, 26, from Chengdu, in China¡¯s southwest Sichuan Province, went to the fast food chain in search of some comfort food to get over the break-up.

But seven days later Tan was still ordering chicken wings with a side of extra large fries at the KFC near a train station by her home.

Lovesick Tan Shen, 26, went to the fast food chain in search of some comfort food to get over the break-up

She even phoned in sick to work to stay at the restaurant.

Tan said: ¡®I was walking around feeling miserable and decided to stop off at the KFC at the train station.

'I hadn¡¯t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings.

'But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.

'I didn¡¯t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.'

After a few days employees at the chicken shop began to worry about Tan.

For seven days Tan ordered chicken wings with extra large fries at the KFC near a train station by her home

Tan said she stayed at the fast food restaurant for so long because she 'needed time to think'

Worker Jiang Li Lung, 22, said: 'We work in shifts here and the restaurant is open 24 hours a day, so we get a lot of people coming through.

'At first no one really noticed her.

'But after a few days I began thinking she looked really familiar.

'Then I realised we had been serving her for the past three days and that she hadn¡¯t actually left.

'When we asked her if she was ok, she said she was and just needed time to think.

'And then asked for another box of chicken wings with extra large fries.'

Tan even called in sick to her work so she could spent time at the KFC recovering from her break-up

He said the Tan was doing no harm eating her way through boxes of chicken so they let her stay.

He added: 'She was after all a paying customer, even if a bit of an odd one.'

Tan decided she had had enough when local media turned up after a week at the KFC. And, unsurprisingly, she was starting to get sick of the taste of chicken.

'I decided the best thing to do would be to leave the city and go back to my parents.

It was only after a week that Tan decided she was 'sick of the taste of chicken' and she went home

'I had already told work I was off sick, so phoned them and said I was leaving.

'And I was getting sick of the taste of chicken so there was no point in staying there anymore.'

She then boarded the next train to her parents' home in Quingdao city in east China¡¯s Shandong Province and left.

Waitress Jiang Li Lung said: 'I guess we kind of miss her. It certainly made work more interesting.'

95,"Kabul: A recent footage of a sniper bullet hitting a US marine on the helmet during a helicopter raid in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, has gone viral on social media.

The importance of wearing a helmet when on the field of battle has been perfectly illustrated in a video uploaded to YouTube by a US marine.

In the video, three marines are seen to move through a bunker in search of a source of gunfire. As they come near to the exit point, a bullet suddenly bounces off the Kevlar helmet of the middle soldier.

The three men then quickly retreat to the back of the building to inspect the damage to the soldier's helmet. After ascertaining that the Marine is unharmed, they regroup to consider their options.

Afghanistan veteran Sam Arnold reportedly said that the video was shot while """"conducting a joint helicopter raid in the Now Zad district, Helmand Province in 2013"""". The footage was uploaded to YouTube last month, and has since received just under 200,000 views."
99,"Shane Smith, the sometimes controversial but always press-friendly CEO of Vice Media, has found another way to make news: reportedly spend $300,000 on a Las Vegas meal.

On a Tuesday earnings call, MGM Resorts International boasted that someone had recently spent $300,000 taking some acquaintances to dinner at one of its restaurants. On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that it was Smith.

The Vice co-founder spent the large sum of money at Bellagio's Prime Steakhouse when he was in Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show last month, Bloomberg reported.

Smith can certainly afford to pick up the tab after A+E Networks and Technology Crossover Ventures each invested $250 million in Vice for 10 percent stakes, on top of a $70 million investment from Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox.

Vice fashions itself a cutting-edge media company that eschews tradition and on occasion even courts danger. It made worldwide news when it took former NBA player Dennis Rodman and the Harlem Globetrotters to North Korea to hang out with Kim Jong Un.

Smith has hinted at an IPO for Vice and guesses it could be worth $20 billion, likely an exaggeration, but an IPO of practically any magnitude would probably make him a billionaire.

A Vice spokesman told The Hollywood Reporter that Smith won """"well north of"""" $300,000 while playing blackjack during his trip to Las Vegas and it was the money from that windfall that funded the dinner.

Still, the reveal of the $300,000 dinner might cause Smith some angst, given that he is being accused in some circles of living the good life while underpaying Vice staffers. 

""""A company as successful as Vice should be paying decent wages. Vice doesn't,"""" says a recent report from Gawker. """"The company pays shitty wages to low-level employees, compensating them instead with the sheer coolness of working for Vice Media.""""

Then again, at a company party in December, Smith gave each full-time employee an envelope with $1,500 cash inside, amounting to a $1 million expenditure, according to insiders.

The 66-year-old singer walked away from a 35-date tour that would have paid the rock group nearly $924 million ? ripping up the contract in front of stunned promoters, The Mirror newspaper reported.

British tycoon Sir Richard Branson had planned to reunite the Stairway to Heaven rockers and promoters had even gotten the green light from the other band members.

The mega deal would have paid Plant, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones roughly $346 million apiece, before taxes, according to The Mirror.

Group members lobbied hard for Plant to join in but he wouldn¡¯t change his mind.

105,"As Apple gears up to launch the Apple Watch in April this year, Tim Cook while talking to an employee at the Apple Store spilled some extra information about the wearable before the launch. He also gave a tentative time-frame as to when Apple Pay will be reaching Europe. Also, analysts have predicted what Apple might offer at the time of its smartwatch launch.

While we already know that Apple Watch will be water resistant, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple further confirmed it as shower-proof, while chatting with a Kurfurstendamm Apple Store (Berlin) employee. Reported by iGen (via 9to5Mac), the CEO said that he always wears the watch - """"even in the shower"""". Cook added that he puts his Apple Watch on charge every night, which reconfirms the expected battery life from Apple's previous statements and multiple reports.

Regarding Apple Pay, Cook said that the firm plans to bring the service to Europe not """"before the end of the year."""" The announcement is somewhat a contradiction to announcements by UK banks, which in the recent past stated they were in talks to bring the Apple Pay system by the first half of 2015. According to Cook, the mobile payment system should reach Canada as soon as next month.

Meanwhile, Trip Chowdhry, an analyst from Global Equities Research has predicted that Apple might introduce as many as 100,000 apps for the Apple Watch by time it gets launched. The huge number comes from six """"Apple Watch-Kit hackathons"""" in the past few months, which Chowdhry attended, according to a Barrons blog post.

He further states that the $350 (roughly Rs. 21,700) price tag for the smartwatch seems to be no issue because """"On an average an Apple Watch user will have 100 Apps installed, and one way to think about it is that the consumer is getting 100 devices for $350..i.e. $3.50 (roughly Rs. 217) per device,"""" considering each app and its function as a single device.

As for the sales, Apple is being expected to ship almost 42 million units by December this year. """"Since Apple Watch extends iPhone functionality and provides user convenience with 'Glance' and 'Notifications' to an iPhone User, almost every current iPhone user, which are about 350 million users, will also be an Apple Watch user,"""" he explains.

Online news sites were subject to a hoax on Friday from US ¡®media troll extaordinaire¡¯ Paul Horner.

108,"WASHINGTON -- Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson shot down claims on Thursday that a """"porous"""" U.S. southern border is allowing terrorists, Ebola and a surge of unaccompanied minors into the country, despite claims to the contrary by some politicians.

Johnson tried to dispel rumors and dial back fears during a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, saying there have been improvements to border security. He said the number of unaccompanied minors apprehended in fiscal year 2014 was 68,434 -- considerably lower than a projection of 90,000. Claims that four terrorists had crossed the border were false, he said, and the government is intensifying efforts to keep Ebola out of the U.S.

But that's not always what people are hearing from politicians or reading in the news, he said.

""""Those of us in public office, and in the media ?- whether in describing the border, ISIL or Ebola -- owe the public informed, careful, and responsible dialogue, not overheated rhetoric that is certain to feed the flames of fear, anxiety and suspicion,"""" Johnson said. ISIL, the terrorist group that calls itself the Islamic State, also is called ISIS.

Recent criticism of the Obama administration over border security has stoked fears over ISIS and Ebola, particularly by Republicans campaigning for November elections. Former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.), now running for Senate in New Hampshire, said on Thursday that the border needed to be secured to prevent the spread of diseases into the country. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) said Tuesday that """"at least"""" 10 members of the Islamic State were apprehended crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, a claim DHS said was false. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) has said that four men with ties to terrorism were apprehended along the border.

Johnson said the four individuals were investigated and found to be members of the Kurdish Worker's Party, which he said """"is actually fighting against ISIL and defended Kurdish territory in Iraq."""" The men remain in detention for unlawful entry, he said. (Chaffetz, for his part, continued to maintain after Johnson's speech that the men are terrorists, according to interview with CBS News.)

On Ebola, Johnson said the government is """"heavily engaged"""" and is """"enhancing our Ebola screening of air passengers from the three affected African countries, and we are continually evaluating whether more is appropriate.""""

""""We very definitely in this country have the capability to deal with the Ebola virus,"""" he said.

Johnson touted border security improvements, but said DHS was still working to improve policies on transparency and internal agency coordination. One change in DHS policy, however, has been receiving considerable pushback from immigration advocates: the increased practice of holding families in detention. The government has expanded facilities for detaining families -- largely mothers with children, many of them seeking asylum -- over the past few months, and plans to add more space.

Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which has been critical of family detention, asked Johnson during a question and answer period after the speech why the government is expanding family detention when many of the women and children being held are seeking asylum and have fled horrific violence.

Johnson said that given the increase this year in families crossing the border -- even though the numbers have dropped recently -- DHS needed to make sure it could detain them.

""""We believe it's necessary to build more of that capability in the event we have another spike like we had last summer,"""" he said.

Although Johnson acknowledged the influx of migrants over the past year was a """"setback,"""" he said there have been improvements in border security, from more resources focused on patrol to fewer border-crossings.

""""In recent years, the total number of those who attempt to cross our southwest border has declined dramatically, while the percentage of those who are apprehended has gone up,"""" he said. """"Put simply, it¡¯s now much harder to cross our border and evade capture than it used to be -? and people know that."""""

110,"As a series of ex-soldiers come forward to criticize Brian Williams for his ¡®stolen valor¡¯ Iraq war story, it is being reported that top level executives at NBC News had known the tale was fake and had been begging the newscaster for years to stop repeating it.

Williams is at a center of a media firestorm after he was found out for embellishing an old war story about being in a helicopter hit by a grenade during the Iraq war in 2003.

The newscaster acted swiftly on Wednesday night to attempt to diffuse the situation by apologizing during his Nightly News show, but since then a series of ex-soldiers have come forward to criticize Williams ¡®half-hearted¡¯ apology.

Brian Williams is at the center of a media firestorm over his embellished war story and now it transpires that NBC News executives - and Tom Brokaw - had known for years that the story was false

To make matters worse there are also now reports that senior executives at NBC News, including legendary anchor Tom Brokaw who Williams replaced in 2004, knew the story was false.

¡®Tom Brokaw and [former NBC News President] Steve Capus knew this was a false story for a long time and have been extremely uncomfortable with it,¡¯ an insider told the New York Post.

Now Brokaw, 74, has had it and wants Williams fired, the Post claims.

Senior executives had in the past asked Williams to stop telling the story in public, reports Variety.

Despite his credibility being called into question, Williams still took the anchor¡¯s seat for his Nightly News broadcast on Thursday evening but unlike on Wednesday he didn't address the issue during the broadcast.

'Brokaw wants Williams¡¯ head on a platter. He is making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report,' said the source.

Retraction: NBC anchor Brian Williams has been forced to admit that he wasn't aboard a helicopter hit and forced down by enemy fire during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, as he claimed in a broadcast on Friday, pictured

However a separate source says that isn't going to happen. 'He is not going to be suspended or reprimanded in any way. He has the full support of NBC News,' said the source.

On Thursday the pilot of the army chinook that was attacked by rocket-propelled grenades told the Omaha World-Herald that he had contacted NBC News not long after their initial broadcast. Don Helus said he saw Williams¡¯ initial report not long after its original broadcast after someone emailed him a clip.

NBC¡¯s Tom Brokaw introduced the report with the words: 'Our colleague Brian Williams is back in Kuwait City tonight after a close call in the skies over Iraq.'

Helus said he contacted Williams¡¯ producer and asked for a retraction, but didn't get a reply.

'My crew was a little upset about that - somebody trying to make a claim to inflate their career,' Helus said.

Williams was forced to apologize on air and on Facebook on Wednesday and admit that he wasn't aboard a helicopter that was hit, but had been traveling in a separate aircraft more than half an hour behind that landed without incident.

'He was actually on my aircraft and we came in behind [the other helicopter] about 30-45 minutes later,' Sgt. 1st Class Joseph Miller, the flight engineer on the helicopter that carried the journalists, wrote on Facebook after NBC shared a link to Williams' story.

Williams pictured in Iraq in 2003 with Command Sgt. Major Tim Terpack: In a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday, Williams admitted his mistake and blamed the 'fog of memory over 12 years' for his error

'He had the audacity to tell me the whole thing was like 'Saving Private Ryan' and that the whole army would be out looking for him. I called him an idiot in front of his camera crew and he didn't come back to my bird for the next three days.'

Pate Butler, another soldier, confirmed on Facebook: 'He flew with the Savannah birds in a totally different flight. Never was shot at. That aircraft was out of Germany and we were all in that flight.'

Lance Reynolds, another soldier who had actually been on the 159th Aviation Regiment's Chinook that was hit, also lashed out at Williams on Facebook.

'Sorry dude, I don't remember you being on my aircraft,' he wrote. 'I do remember you walking up about an hour after we had landed to ask me what had happened.

'Then I remember you guys taking back off in a different flight of Chinooks from another unit and heading to Kuwait to report your 'war story' to the Nightly News.

'The whole time we were still stuck in Iraq trying to repair the aircraft and pulling our own Security.'

Speaking to Stars and Stripes, Reynolds recalled how he had been aboard the helicopter when it was hit by two rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire.

The damaged Chinook made a rolling landing at an Iraqi airfield, skidded off the runway and came to a stop in the desert. Reynolds and other crew members were unhurt.

Called out: Lance Reynolds, left, and Pate Butler, right, who were both part of the crews flying that day, said that Williams had not been aboard their damaged helicopter and expressed their anger at his lies

Anger: The day after Williams' report, Reynolds responded to the story on NBC NIghtly News' Facebook and said that he remembered things rather differently

Another man, Joseph Miller, who claimed to be on Williams' aircraft at the time said he had been 'calling him out on this for a long time with no response'

'It was something personal for us that was kind of life-changing for me,' he told Stars and Stripes.

'I know how lucky I was to survive it. It felt like a personal experience that someone else wanted to participate in and didn't deserve to participate in.'

When Williams approached him and took photos of the damaged aircraft, Reynolds said he dismissed the level of danger because he didn't want his wife to see a news report about it.

'I wanted to tell her myself everything was all right before she got news of this happening,' he said.

Another man on the downed aircraft, Mike O'Keeffe, said he had long been bothered by Williams' false claims.

'Over the years it faded,' he said, 'and then to see it last week it was - I can't believe he is still telling this false narrative.'

O'Keeffe added that he was satisfied with Williams' apology and didn't want to push the issue any further or 'kick the guy when he is down'.

Other soldiers have accused Williams of being misleading in his apology and continuing to imply details that are false.

Denial: Williams denied that he was 'trying to steal anyone's valor' in a message he posted on Wednesday

Since the 2003 incident, Williams' Chinook story has been recounted countless times and gradually the reporter's role seems to have grown.

NBC reported the incident on March 26, 2003, with the headline, 'Target Iraq: Helicopter NBC's Brian Williams Was Riding In Comes Under Fire.'

However when the incident was reported the next day by the New York Daily News it stated that a 'chopper was hit and forced to land. Then the one carrying Williams landed.'

Three days later USA Today carried a similar report that stated: 'NBC's Brian Williams was stranded in the Iraqi desert for three days after a Chinook helicopter ahead of his was attacked by a man who fired a rocket-propelled grenade.

'The grenade just missed, but it forced the group to make an emergency landing. Luckily, a U.S. tank platoon was there and surrounded the helicopters, killing four Iraqis.'

In a 2007 entry from his blog Williams recounts how he was part of a 'flotilla of four twin-rotor Chinook helicopters'.

'Some men on the ground fired an RPG through the tail rotor of the chopper flying in front of ours.

'There was small arms fire. ¡¦ All four choppers dropped their heavy loads and landed quickly and hard on the desert floor,' he recalled.

By the next year Williams was claiming on his blog that 'all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire.'

'The Chinook helicopter flying in front of ours (from the 101st Airborne) took an RPG to the rear rotor, as all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire,' he wrote.

'We were forced down and stayed down -- for the better (or worse) part of 3 days and 2 nights.'

The tale takes a more dramatic twist during a 2013 appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman. By now Williams is recalling that two helicopter were hit - including his.

'Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire including the one I was in,' he told Letterman.

Then during his report on January 30, Williams once again told an inaccurate version of events so that now 'the helicopter we were travelling in was forced down after being hit by an RPG.'

For example, army flight crews told Stars and Stripes that Williams implied he was flying with the same company that the downed helicopter belonged to - but he was actually flying with a different company in a different direction, and only linked to the unit by radio.

He also suggested that his aircraft was forced to land because of the attack, but soldiers said it was landed due to deteriorating weather conditions.

After Williams' apology, there were cries for him to be terminated.

'Brian Williams has to go,' Brent Bozell, the founder and president of the Media Research Center, wrote on Twitter. 'NBC's credibility is completely shot.'

The Nightly News anchor has often repeated the war story over the past 12 years about how the aircraft he was on was forced down by enemy fire.

He repeated his old war story on Friday when he presented a segment about a public tribute at a hockey game in New York for Command Sgt. Major Tim Terpack, a retired soldier who had provided security for the grounded helicopters.

During the report, Williams went further and said that the aircraft he was on had actually been hit - and the soldiers expressed their anger on Facebook afterwards.

'I would not have chosen to make this mistake,' Williams told Stars and Stripes. 'I don't know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another.'

On the Nightly News broadcast on Wednesday evening, Williams told viewers that his mistake was a 'bungled attempt' to honor a soldier who had helped protect him.

'I made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago. I want to apologize,' he said.

In a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday Williams admitted his mistake and blamed the 'fog of memory over 12 years' for his error.

'I feel terrible about making this mistake, especially since I found my OWN WRITING about the incident from back in '08, and I was indeed on the Chinook behind the bird that took the RPG in the tail housing just above the ramp,' he wrote.

'Because I have no desire to fictionalize my experience (we all saw it happened the first time) and no need to dramatize events as they actually happened, I think the constant viewing of the video showing us inspecting the impact area - and the fog of memory over 12 years - made me conflate the two, and I apologize.'

Williams went on to strenuously deny that he was 'trying to steal anyone's valor'.

'I was and remain a civilian journalist covering the stories of those who volunteered for duty. This was simply an attempt to thank Tim, our military and Veterans everywhere -- those who have served while I did not.'

All the credit: After his apology, Twitter users joked about Williams inserting himself in other historic events

One of the top trending topics on Twitter on Wednesday night was #BrianWilliamsMisremembers.

'#BrianWilliamsMisremembers and then I said look Woodward you and Bernstein are in way over your head,time to follow a real man..lets do this,' tweeted one person.

'And I just knew we could make a better portable music player. Called it the iPod.' #BrianWilliamsMisremembers,' wrote another.

However when the incident was reported the next day by the New York Daily News it stated that a 'chopper was hit and forced to land. Then the one carrying Williams landed.'

Original report: In 2003, Williams reported that another helicopter had been shot at - not the one he was on

Damage: The original report shows the damage suffered by the Chinook after it was shot at in 2003

Three days later USA Today carried a similar report that stated: 'NBC's Brian Williams was stranded in the Iraqi desert for three days after a Chinook helicopter ahead of his was attacked by a man who fired a rocket-propelled grenade.

'The grenade just missed, but it forced the group to make an emergency landing. Luckily, a U.S. tank platoon was there and surrounded the helicopters, killing four Iraqis.'

In a 2007 entry from his blog Williams recounts how he was part of a 'flotilla of four twin-rotor Chinook helicopters'.

'Some men on the ground fired an RPG through the tail rotor of the chopper flying in front of ours.

'There was small arms fire. ¡¦ All four choppers dropped their heavy loads and landed quickly and hard on the desert floor,' he recalled.

By the next year Williams was claiming on his blog that 'all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire.'

'The Chinook helicopter flying in front of ours (from the 101st Airborne) took an RPG to the rear rotor, as all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire,' he wrote.

Williams appeared nonplussed about the scandal on Wednesday evening as he enjoyed a New York Rangers game with his good friend Tom Hanks

Actor Tom Hanks and Brian Williams pictured together at the Boston Bruins game at Madison Square Garden

The two shared plenty of laughs and thrills at the game only hours after Williams apologized for his 'mistake'

'We were forced down and stayed down -- for the better (or worse) part of 3 days and 2 nights.'

The tale takes a more dramatic twist during a 2013 appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman. By now Williams is recalling that two helicopter were hit - including his.

'Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire including the one I was in,' he told Letterman.

Then during his report on January 30, Williams once again told an inaccurate version of events so that now 'the helicopter we were travelling in was forced down after being hit by an RPG.'

Williams has anchored NBC Nightly News - the nation's highest rated news program - since December 2004 when he replaced Tom Brokaw.

His reporting from inside the New Orleans Superdome in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina the next year helped earn NBC a Peabody Award.

112,"The man who scaled the White House fence this month actually ran through the building into the East Room, much farther than the Secret Service initially disclosed.

The intruder overpowered a Secret Service officer posted near the door before penetrating deep into the mansion¡¯s main floor, the Washington Post reported:

An alarm box near the front entrance of the White House designed to alert guards to an intruder had been muted at what officers believed was a request of the usher¡¯s office, said a Secret Service official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The female officer posted inside the front door appeared to be delayed in learning that the intruder, Omar Gonzalez, was about to burst through. Officers are trained that, upon learning of an intruder on the grounds, often through the alarm boxes posted around the property, they must immediately lock the front door.

After barrelling past the guard immediately inside the door, Gonzalez, who was carrying a knife, dashed past the stairway leading a half-flight up to the first family¡¯s living quarters. He then ran into the 80-foot-long East Room, an ornate space often used for receptions or presidential addresses.

Gonzalez was tackled by a counter-assault agent at the far southern end of the East Room. The intruder reached the doorway to the Green Room, a parlor overlooking the South Lawn with artwork and antique furniture, according to three people familiar with the incident.

Subsequently his company Mark-1 Plumbing ? the name emblazoned on the pick-up truck in Syria ? has been bombarded with hate calls at the office in Texas City, Texas.

¡°A few of the people are really ugly,¡± he told Galveston Daily News.

117,"Reasons cited for his mysterious disappearance range from ill health through an addiction to cheese to him being placed under house arrest.
Now the latest explanation for Kim Jong Un's conspicuous absence is that he has simply injured his leg.  
A source with access to the secretive North's leadership today insisted the leader is in firm control of his government, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's health and grip on power.
North Korea's state media, which usually chronicles Kim's whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on September 3. 
The source said that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises.
He IS Un-well: The North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month because he pulled a tendon while exercising with his generals, a source with access to the dictatorship has said, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's grip on power after claims he had been placed under house arrest

He IS Un-well: The North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month because he pulled a tendon while exercising with his generals, a source with access to the dictatorship has said, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's grip on power after claims he had been placed under house arrest
'He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too. 
'They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon,' the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
'He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. 
He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened,' the source said.

Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury.
Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source, whose information could not be independently verified.
'Kim Jong Un is in total control,' said the source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing.

Friday is the 69th anniversary of the founding of North Korea's Workers' Party, an event Kim has marked in the past two years with a post-midnight visit to the Pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred.
If Kim does not turn up, it could fuel speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle, experts said.
'The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow,' said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. 
North Korean officials have denied that Kim's public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble.
It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view.

In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days.
He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium.
Speculation that Kim's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a North Korean TV report late last month that said he was suffering from 'discomfort'.
Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.
Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang.
The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Un's health said rumours of a coup were 'rubbish'.
'It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans,' said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based NGO running a programme for North Koreans in Southeast Asia.
North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centred on the ruling Kim family. Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye.
Kim was absent from a Sept. 25 meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago.
However, Kim's name has not disappeared from state propaganda.
Thursday's edition of the Workers' Party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page, and has reported on returning athletes from the Asian Games who thanked 'the Marshal' for his support during the competition.
Abrahamian said it was unlikely Kim had been usurped.
'Kim Jong Un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted, it is unlikely that they would want to remove him, given his unmatchable symbolic value. Again, though, everyone is guessing,' he said."

119,"TEXAS CITY, Texas (AP) ? A Texas plumber is getting some unwanted attention after one of his old company vehicles appeared in a photo posted on an Islamic militant group's social media account.

Mark-1 Plumbing in Texas City has been flooded with calls after the picture appeared on Twitter, The Galveston County Daily News reported.

The picture was posted online by the Islamic extremist group Ansar al-Deen Front, according to a CBS News report.

The photo shows a black pickup truck with a Mark-1 Plumbing decal on the door and an anti-aircraft gun in the bed.

Mark Oberholtzer, who has owned the company for 32 years, said he traded that truck at an AutoNation dealership three years ago and has no idea how it ended up in Syria. He usually takes the decals off his vehicles when he sells them but he left it on this vehicle, believing AutoNation would remove it.

""""They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn't do it,"""" Oberholtzer said. """"How it ended up in Syria, I'll never know.""""

Oberholtzer said his business has received a thousand calls and faxes this week about the photo.

""""A few of the people are really ugly,"""" he said.

Oberholtzer said he just wanted people to know the vehicle was no longer his.

Attorney Lopa Blumenthal says the recording was made during a video chat. The audio captures what seem like 10 gunshot sounds?an initial group of six, then a pause, then four more. An autopsy of Brown's body performed at his family's request by an experienced forensic pathologist named Michael Baden indicated Brown was hit by at least six shots.

Eyewitness Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown's, has said that officer Darren Wilson fired several shots at Brown after Brown had turned toward him and raised his hands. The Baden autopsy indicated that Brown had been shot exclusively in the front of his body.

121,"Claim: Deandre Joshua was murdered after testifying before a grand jury in Ferguson.

FALSE

Example: [Collected via email, December 2014]

Deandre Joshua, 20 was murdered after testifying to a grand jury in the ferguson, MO case. Supposedly he was found not far from where Brown's body was & he was covered in lighter fluid. It was a post I saw on FB & just wondered if it was true.

Origins: Shortly after a 20-year-old man named Deandre Joshua was killed in Ferguson, Missouri, on 24 November 2014, rumors started circulating around the Internet connecting the young man's murder to the non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson in the controversial shooting death of Michael Brown.

The details of Joshua's death are gruesome. According to the Washington Post, Deandre was shot once in the head and then burned inside his car. The incident occurred on the same night protesters took to the streets of Ferguson to protest the grand jury's decision not to indict Darren Wilson. These circumstances, coupled with the fact that Joshua was a friend of Dorian Johnson, who was with Mike Brown on the night of his death, led many to believe Joshua's murder was in some way connected to Wilson's non-indictment:

This is Deandre Joshua. This 20 year old man testified in the Grand Jury case against Darren Wilson. He was shot and killed on Tuesday. His body was found, with lighter fluid all over it, not far from where Darren Wilson killed Michael Brown. Why are broken windows on the front page of our news, and not his face?

However, there is no documentation Deandre Joshua testified before the grand jury. According to the Boston Globe , names of the witnesses were kept secret, and anyone who disclosed that information would face a misdemeanor charge. Additionally, Joshua's family and friends told the New York Times he was nowhere near the scene when Mike Brown was shot and killed, and prosecutors confirmed he was not a grand jury witness:

According to family members, friends and law-enforcement officials, however, Joshua was nowhere near Canfield Drive when Brown was killed during a confrontation with Wilson on Aug. 9 and couldn't have witnessed the shooting. And McCulloch's office, which remained tight-lipped about the Wilson investigation, confirmed that Joshua didn't offer testimony during the proceedings.

""""He was not a witness,"""" said Ed Magee, a spokesman for the county prosecutor.

Deandre Joshua did not witness the shooting of Michael Brown, nor did he testify before the grand jury. The only connection that Joshua had to the case was that he was a childhood friend of Dorian Johnson (who did witness the shooting):

As of 2 December 2014, Deandre Joshua's death is still under investigation by police. It is unclear who killed Joshua or why they did so, but it is clear is Joshua's death was not retaliation for grand jury testimony in the Brown case.""""

Describing the child as ISIS' youngest jihadist, chilling photographs taken before his alleged death show him smiling at the camera, wearing military fatigues and brandishing a huge assault rifle.

ISIS sympathisers took to social media to identify the 'cub fighter' by his alleged nom de guerre Abu Ubaidah, adding that both he and his father were killed during clashes in Syria in recent weeks, but not specifying exactly where they died or who they had been fighting against.

Several images, which have not been independently verified, emerged on social media this week after a video reporting the deaths of the boy and his father was uploaded to YouTube in September.

The original video - distributed by the pro-Isis media group Al-A'amaq - is understood to have since been removed, but a number of photographs of the boy have since been widely shared by ISIS militants and their sympathisers on social media.

One image shows the boy standing inside a house, grinning as he struggles to hold an assault rifle so large that it threatens to topple him over.

Another picture shows him smiling sweetly while wearing an ammunition vest as he stands next to a van that has been converted into an armoured vehicle with a large plank of wood and bull bars.

Other images show him posing with a man understood to be his father, who militants named as 'Baghdadi'. In those images the boy identified as Abu Ubaidah is seen calmly holding another large rifle while surrounded by bearded men wearing military clothing.

Last week a 24-year-old Muslim convert admitted taking her infant son to live among Islamic State terrorists in the Syrian city of Raqqa because she believes he will lead a 'better life' under their brutal regime.

Asiya Ummi Abdullah denied that children are unhappy living under the oppressive rule of ISIS' religious fanatics and explained that she felt her three-year-old son's spiritual well-being was better served in the group's de facto capital, where public crucifixions and beheadings are commonplace.

Ummi Abduallah - who had lived in Turkey since her teens but was born in Kyrgyzstan - said moving to the militant stronghold in Syria was in part to shield the young boy from the sex, crime, drugs and alcohol she sees as rampant in her home town Istanbul.

'Who says children here are unhappy?... He will know God and live under his rules,' she said.

Dramatic footage has emerged from inside Kobane showing brave Kurdish fighters battling against militants from the Islamic State.

The clip, which appears to have been filmed on a mobile phone, shows resistance forces from the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) firing assault rifles and machine guns mounted on the back of a car at militants hiding behind buildings in the Kobane suburbs.

The terrorists launched a renewed assault on Kobane last night, killing dozens of Kurds who have resisted ISIS' advances into the city's suburbs over the last three weeks.

Prepared: A Kurdish fighter takes up his position to fight the Islamic State jihadists

Islamic State militants are now in control of one third of the besieged Syrian city of Kobane despite three days of American airstrikes, a group monitoring violence in the country said today.

This morning the chilling sight of the group's black flag could clearly be seen above buildings inside the city; a brazen display of defiance in the face of sustained airstrikes by U.S. and Arab warplanes.

While the airstrikes appear to have slowed the militants advance in some areas of the city, ISIS fighters appear to be creeping ever closer to the centre of Kobane, where thousands of civilians unable or unwilling to flee their homes face rape and massacre.

News of ISIS' gains came as the Pentagon admitted airstrikes alone will not be enough to prevent the fall of Kobane, raising serious questions over the U.S.'s wider campaign against the terror group.

Still flying: This morning the chilling sight of the group's black flag could clearly be seen above buildings inside the city; a brazen display of defiance in the face of sustained airstrikes by U.S. and Arab warplanes

Dramatic: The escalation in Kobane has seen the U.S. and Arab coalition carry out the most sustained period of bombing raids since their campaign to destroy the Islamic State in northern Syria started two weeks ago

Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said airstrikes are 'not going to be enough to save that city', amid growing concern that without Western ground troops being sent into Syria, the defeat of ISIS will prove a near impossible task.

Heavily outgunned Kurdish defenders said Islamic State militants had pushed into two districts of Kobane - a mainly Kurdish border city with 40,000 residents - by late last night.

Washington said the U.S. military and Arab partner nations responded to ISIS renewed assault by carrying out eight air strikes last night, adding that for now the city remains under Kurdish control.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights this morning said that despite overnight airstrikes, which have continued into this morning, Islamic State fighters managed to capture a police station in the east of Kobane and now control one third of the city."

However, an analysts citing supply chain sources claims to have narrowed down a significant proportion of the specifications.

According to Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company (via AppleInsider), Apple's smartwatch will feature 512MB of RAM, likely supplied by Samsung, Hynix and Micron. The Apple Watch is also being tipped to come in 4GB and 8GB variants, with the 4GB model the standard version. Arcuri says the flash-based storage will be procured from """"most major NAND suppliers.""""

Arcuri also predicted that Broadcom BCM43342 chipset might act as the wireless combination chip for the Apple Watch. Interestingly, the chipset includes a GPS radio functionality, which is """"somewhat at odds"""" with Apple's announcement of the Watch requiring to be paired with the iPhone for GPS data. The report speculates that either Apple has used a modified version of the chipset, or disabled GPS functionality for better battery life.

Scheduled to arrive in early 2015, the Apple Watch's wireless charging circuit seems to be supplied by Integrated Device Technology, while the NFC chips, power management integrated circuits, MEMS sensor, microcontroller, and Wi-Fi front-end chips are said to be supplied by NXP and AMS, Maxim Integrated Products and Dialog Semiconductor, Invensense, STMicroelectronics, and Skyworks respectively.

The Apple Watch was launched alongside the Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets at the firm's keynote event earlier this month. There are three variants of the Apple Watch - Watch Sport, Watch Edition and the Watch.

Across the three variants, there are a total of 18 different styles of straps available, which means that users will be able to customise the Apple Watch - both physically and in terms of software, to stand out from others, but Apple hasn't given out details on the pricing of different designs yet."
130,"Social media around the world have been flooded with rumors of Fidel Castro's death, but there was no sign Friday that the reports were true, even if the 88-year-old former Cuban leader has not been seen in public for months.

Similar speculation has swept across Cuban expatriate communities repeatedly over the decades, particularly after a serious illness forced him to step down from duties as president in 2006, handing over leadership to his younger brother Raul.

The new wave was prompted in part by Fidel Castro's failure to comment after the U.S. and Cuba declared on Dec. 17 that they would move to restore full diplomatic relations broken a half century ago.

The chatter appeared to pick up when some media noted Thursday that Castro had not been seen in public in a year. He last appeared on Jan. 8, 2014, at an art exhibition in Havana, ending nine months out of public view.

The most recent official photographs of Castro came out of a private meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Aug. 21. He was also photographed with the Chinese and Russian presidents in July. Castro was last heard from on Oct. 18, when he published an editorial about Ebola.

By Friday, Cuba-related Twitter accounts were ablaze with speculation, fueled in large part by reports on news websites such as Diario de Cuba and Diario las Americas that Cuba had scheduled a news conference, possibly to discuss Castro's health.

The rumors were further stoked when respected Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera reported on its website that Castro had died. It quickly pulled the report back, however.

Cuban officials told news media in Havana that no press conference had been called, and there were no obvious signs of official preparations for mourning."

In the first report that jihadists are using captured fighter planes, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has cited witnesses who saw the jets in Aleppo province.

""""They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for [former Iraqi president] Saddam Hussein,"""" it said. """"People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport.""""

146,"US drones are being flown over Isil's Syrian """"capital"""" for the first time as part of a drive by America to target Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the jihadist group's elusive leader.

Residents of the northern Syrian city of Raqqa have captured photo and video footage of remotely-piloted planes, which Western weapons experts have identified as American Predators, the same drones used in Pakistan and Yemen to attack suspected terrorists.

The US has not publicly stated that it is flying drones over Syria, and the sightings over Raqqa are the first indication that it is doing so.

The sightings are the clearest indication that President Barack Obama has dramatically changed his policy, aggressively stepping up reconnaissance of Isil positions as the US works to assemble an international coalition to fight the jihadists.

That diplomatic effort was given a major boost on Monday when Iraq's parliament finally voted to approve a new government aimed at winning broad support against Isil, with Haider al-Abadi as prime minister.

Mr Abadi, a member of Iraq's Shia majority, whose candidacy was supported by the US and other western powers, had promised to include members of the Sunni minority as well as Kurds within his government. The attempt to heal sectarian rifts is seen as vital to undermining Isil's appeal in the Sunni heartlands, where disaffection with the previous Shia-dominated government assisted the extremist Islamist group in its rise.

Mr Obama immediately called Haider al-Abadi, the new prime minister, and urged him to move quickly to address """"the legitimate grievances"""" of Iraq's disenchanted Sunnis.

John Kerry, the US secretary of state, said the formation of the unity government was """"a major milestone"""" for Iraq.

MPs in Baghdad also voted to approve three senior figures in the largely ceremonial role of deputy presidents: Nouri al-Maliki, ousted as prime minister in July, Osama al-Nujeifi, a Sunni and former parliament speaker, and Iyad Allawi, a secular Shia politician who refused to join the last government.

But the all-important posts of interior and defence ministers would be filled over the next week, Mr Abadi told MPs.

In the battle against Isil, the Pentagon told the Telegraph on Monday that it had """"not yet conducted any strikes against targeted individuals"""", but refused to rule out the possibility that it was using drones for surveillance.

The US is trying to pinpoint the location of Baghdadi, the jihadist who has declared himself the caliph of captured territory in Iraq and Syria that is the size of Britain, and ruler of its eight million inhabitants.

Several residents of Raqqa and jihadists from Isil have captured pictures of a white drone circling overhead, reporting that it flew low over the city for most of Friday and again on Saturday.

Abu Ibrahim al-Raqqawi, an anti-Isil activist in Raqqa who posted pictures of the drone, told The Telegraph he had first seen it on Friday. """"It flew over the city for about three hours, from noon until 3pm,"""" said Mr Raqqawi, who uses a pseudonym to protect his identity.

Mr Raqqawi also reported seeing it on Saturday at the same time that other residents posted news of the sightings online.

Experts said they believed the aircraft was an unarmed MQ-1 Predator on a reconnaissance flight. Aaron Stein, an associate fellow with the Royal United Services Institute think tank, said it could be identified by its """"distinct downward facing V-shaped tail"""".

Mr Stein said that the photographs indicated the drone was unarmed. """"The evidence thus far suggests that the drone is acquiring imagery - and possibly signals intelligence - of Islamic State positions in the group's most important stronghold.""""

Killing Baghdadi would be a major coup for the US president, who has been widely criticised for not taking tough enough action against Isil.

Its impact on the jihadist group is less certain, however: Baghdadi sits at the apex of an elaborate hierarchy, with a """"cabinet"""" of deputies who manage the group's military operations and domestic governance.

In the event of his death, power would probably transfer to his deputy, Fadel Ahmad Abdullah al-Hiyali, a former commander in Saddam Hussein's military who is in charge of Isil's Iraqi territory.

In July Baghdadi made a surprise appearance in Mosul, Iraq's second city, where he led men in prayers at the city's Great Mosque, but he rarely shows himself publicly and little is known about his whereabouts since then.

Raqqa, a key city in Isil's embryonic """"state"""", would need to be scrutinised closely in any hunt for Baghdadi.

Mr Obama would be required personally to order a strike against the Isil leader, weighing the advantages of his death against the risk of civilian casualties, but Aki Peritz, a former CIA counter-terrorism analyst, predicted he would do so if the opportunity arose.

""""The US is already exerting lethal force against the Islamic State. If it had the opportunity to take its top dog off the battlefield once and for all, the US would pull the trigger,"""" Mr Peritz said.

The US president is due to give a speech on Wednesday preparing the American public for a campaign against Isil tha officials believe could extend beyond Mr Obama's remaining two years in office.

In an interview with NBC, Mr Obama said the US would fight Isil in a manner """"similar to the kinds of counter-terrorism campaigns that we've been engaging in consistently over the last five, six, seven years.""""

He has put drone strikes at the heart of America's global struggle against jihadist groups. Last week the US announced it had killed the leader of Somalia's al-Shabaab terror group."
147,"Tiger Woods is not serving a suspension from the PGA Tour for failing a drug test, his agent and a Tour official emphatically stated Monday.

¡°These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,¡± Mark Steinberg said in a statement (via ESPN). ¡°They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous.¡±

The allegations were made by golf pro Dan Olsen on 730 The Game radio in East Lansing, Mich., Friday. ¡°I¡¯ve heard that he¡¯s suspended,¡± Olsen said on ¡°Mad Dog in the Morning.¡± ¡°I heard he¡¯s on a month¡¯s suspension. And it¡¯s not, it¡¯s kind of a strong witness. It¡¯s a credible person that¡¯s telling me this. Well, it¡¯s not testosterone, but it¡¯s something else.¡±

Woods, who has struggled mentally and physically with his game, announced Feb. 11 that he was taking an indefinite leave from golf, saying his game ¡°needs a lot of work.¡± Among his many injuries over the last few years, he underwent a microdiscectomy last spring. He was withdrawn from play three times because of an injury and no longer ranks among the world¡¯s top 70 players.

On Monday, Olsen, a 48-year-old who last played on the Tour in 2011, was walking back his allegations.

¡°Everything I said on that radio interview was only my opinion and not based on any first-hand knowledge or facts,¡± Olsen told ESPN. ¡°I want to make a full retraction to everything I said for the entire radio interview. And I apologize to Tiger, Nike, Phil [Mickelson], [Commissioner] Tim Finchem and the PGA Tour.¡±

Olsen had questioned the Nike ball with which Woods plays, too, saying, ¡°I would almost bet hadn¡¯t been tested. ¡¦ So he¡¯s really playing with ? I¡¯m not gonna say a cheater ball, because he has the help of the establishment, really ? but he played a ball that nobody else could play. ¡¦ So that combined with his enhancement issues, like having a Canadian blood spinning doctor in his phone, you know? I mean, I think people are starting to openly call it what it is, which is gonna be a problem for him.¡±

Ty Votaw, executive vice president of the PGA Tour, shot down the report Monday, too, and the Tour, according to ESPN, says it is required to announce a suspension.

149,"What's thought to be an audio recording of the shooting death of Michael Brown has reportedly surfaced. According to CNN, an unidentified man, who has since been interviewed by the FBI, is said to have managed to record the incident in which Michael Brown was shot by Officer Darren Wilson earlier this month, setting off a national firestorm. 
The most notable tidbit from the short recording (and what will become subject to the most immediately scrutiny and parsing) is the existence of two distinct volleys of gunfire from Officer Darren Wilson's weapon. From CNN:

class=""""cnn_storypgraphtxt cnn_storypgraph3"""">In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.

The man who recorded the shooting was talking to someone on video chat when the sounds of gunfire erupted in the background. The Daily Mail added:

Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows, if it is authentic, that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown.""""
Also of some serious importance, should the tape's authenticity be confirmed, is the fact that ten (or, by some counts, eleven) shots were fired at Brown by Wilson."

Listening to the message he said: """"It's just a wonderful, wonderful sound that I thought was lost forever.

""""I'm staggered at the lengths they have gone to.""""

Mr Beaton told BBC Radio Leeds the message he had kept since his wife's death from cancer was lost in December.

He said: """"I've always resisted changing companies because whenever I mentioned that my wife's voice was our voicemail message and would it be retained and each company said no, so that's why I never changed.

Researchers of the anomalous say that environment around us is filled with various vibrations - mechanical movements, electromagnetic vibrations, molecular vibrations, etc. We all live in an ocean of electromagnetic waves. Some people may act as magnet coils, accumulating and intensifying energy, making various items stick to their body. Some researchers believe that such anomalous phenomena are more common in the areas where ecological situation is poor.

155,"Comcast allegedly pulled strings to get one of their customers fired from his job at a prestigious accounting firm after he complained about billing issues and false charges. The former Comcast customer, identified only as """"Conal,"""" told his story to Consumerist, the site whose readers have named Comcast """"the worst company in America"""" two years running.

Conal says his trouble started with a few erratic charges: Bills sometimes didn't show up, and he was charged for equipment that was never activated, or that he didn't actually have. Customer service reps promised the problems would be resolved. Instead, things got significantly more hellish in October of last year.

According to Conal, Comcast sent him nearly $2,000 of equipment he'd never ordered and didn't want, and tried to bill him for it anyway.

But, as an accountant by trade, he had no problem documenting every billing error and overcharge, and he brought them in as a spreadsheet when he dropped off the unwanted DVRs, modems, and other equipment.

Even then, Conal says, he wasn't able to get his money back. Instead, Comcast sent him to collections in February.

And this is where Conal made the call that allegedly cost him his job. Per Consumerist:

On Feb. 6, 2014, he chose to try going above Comcast's customer service, which hadn't been of any help in the year he'd been a subscriber, and instead contacted the office of the company's Controller. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues.

He describes that callback as """"bizarre,"""" with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with """"How can I help you?"""" Then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment, but wouldn't specify which appointment. The rep then began asking him for the color of his house.

So he tried the Controller's office again, to let them know that the rep they'd sent his way had failed miserably at her job.

Considering that even Comcast acknowledges its customer service experience is so broken that it could take years to reform, you can hardly blame a customer who understands corporate structures for escalating his complaint.

Comcast did blame Conal, though. Consumerist again:

At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal's subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he'd only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.

The creepiest part is that, although he was allegedly fired for throwing around the name of his powerful employer?who, surprise, happens to do business with Comcast?Conal swears he never told anyone at Comcast where he worked. He believes they just went the extra mile to look him up online and contact his company?because Comcast cares.

Comcast has confirmed at least one part of the story: In a letter to Conal's lawyer, who is considering filing suit against the cable provider, Comcast's lawyer said the company did contact Conal's job.

Comcast's counsel says the ex-customer """"is not in a position to complain that the firm came to learn"""" about his customer service struggle.

It seems that arguing with you on the phone for 20 minutes or trying to talk you into paying fees you know are fradulent is nowhere near the worst thing Comcast can inflict on you, the customer.

They can apparently also wreck your life in ways that have nothing to do with your cable or internet services.

Really looking forward to Comcast becoming basically the only cable provider in America!

But one man's love of sashimi nearly killed him after it led to his body becoming riddled with tapeworm.

One man's love of sashimi nearly killed him after it led to his body becoming riddled with tapeworm

The Chinese man had seen his doctor complaining of stomach ache and itchy skin. Scans revealed his entire body had been infected with tapeworm parasites after eating too much sashimi - raw slices of fish

Humans contract tapeworm infections from sushi by eating raw fish that has been infected with the worm in its larvae stage.

When fish eat tapeworm eggs, the hatching larvae attach themselves to the intestinal wall of the fish and the worms infect the fish flesh.

Because sushi is not cooked, the larvae can in turn transfer into the flesh of any human that eats the fish.

Once a human is infected, a tapeworm will grow inside the intestine to a length of up to 15metres over a period of weeks. It can survive for years and go undetected for weeks or months, in turn releasing its own eggs that infect other parts of the human body.

Symptoms include fatigue, constipation and abdominal discomfort - which can be so mild the victim may not notice anything is wrong.

If larvae begin to migrate to other parts of the body they can start to eat away at the liver, eyes, heart or brain and cause life-threatening conditions.

Doctors believe some of the uncooked Japanese delicacy of raw meat or fish must have become contaminated.

He was treated at the Guangzhou No. 8 People's Hospital in Guangdong Province, in eastern China.

Research has shown that eating raw or undercooked fish can lead to a variety of parasitic infections.

Tapeworm infections occur after ingesting the larvae of diphyllobothrium, found in freshwater fish such as salmon, although marinated and smoked fish can also transmit the worm.

While cases have increased in poorer areas due to improved sanitation, cases have increased in more developed countries,.

This is most likely due to the soaring popularity of sushi, say doctors writing in the journal Canadian Family Physician.

Study author Nancy Craig wrote: 'The widespread popularity of Japanese sushi and sashimi (slices of raw fish) is a contributor.

'But other popular dishes might also be implicated, such as raw salted or marinated fillets - which originate from Baltic and Scandinavian countries - carpaccio - very thin slices of raw fish common in Italy, raw salmon and ceviche - lightly marinated fish.'

Dr Yin, of Guangzhou No. 8 People¡¯s Hospital, told the website that'smags.com that eating uncooked food contaminated with tapeworms' eggs could eventually cause cysticercosis, when the adult worms enters a person¡¯s blood stream.

This type of infection is life-threatening once it reaches the brain.

158,"Hundreds of Palestinians were evacuated from their homes Sunday morning after Israeli authorities opened a number of dams near the border, flooding the Gaza Valley in the wake of a recent severe winter storm.

The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the Ministry of Public Works had evacuated more than 80 families from both sides of the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters.

Gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down.

The storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands, including many of the approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel's assault over summer.

The suffering is compounded by the fact that Israel has maintained a complete siege over Gaza for the last eight years, severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators. It has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes, as construction materials are largely banned from entering.

Gaza civil defense services spokesman Muhammad al-Midana warned that further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams in the area, noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the Israel border through the valley and into the Mediterranean sea.

Evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighborhood in the central Gaza Strip.

The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) is a wetland located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It is called HaBesor in Hebrew, and it flows from two streams -- one whose source runs from near Beersheba, and the other from near Hebron.

Israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside Gaza, and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area.

Locals have continued to use it to dispose of their waste for lack of other ways to do so, however, creating an environmental hazard.

This is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the Gaza Valley dams.

In Dec. 2013, Israeli authorities also opened the dams amid heavy flooding in the Gaza Strip. The resulting floods damaged dozens of homes and forces many families in the area from their homes.

In 2010, the dams were opened as well, forcing 100 families from their homes. At the time civil defense services said that they had managed to save seven people who had been at risk of drowning."

Islamic State has been flying the planes over the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report and U.S. Central Command said it was not aware of Islamic State flying jets in Syria.

¡°They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein,¡± Abdulrahman said. ¡°People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,¡± he said, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 70 kilometressouth of the Turkish border.

Witnesses reported the flights were at a low altitude and only lasted five to 10 minutes before landing, the observatory said. It was not possible to reach the Syrian government for comment and state media did not mention the report.

It was not clear whether the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances in the planes, which witnesses said appeared to be MiG 21 or MiG 23 models captured from the Syrian military.

General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. military¡¯s Central Command, said he could not confirm that Iraqi pilots had joined Islamic State. ¡°We don¡¯t have any operational reporting of ISIL flying jets in support of ISIL activity on the ground and so I cannot confirm that. And to the degree that pilots may have defected and joined the ranks of ISIL, I don¡¯t have any information on that either,¡± he told a Pentagon news briefing, referring to Islamic State by an acronym.

LONDON: POLICE ALLEGE ISLAMIST PLOT TO KILL POLICE

Four men appeared in a British court on Friday, charged under anti-terrorism legislation with swearing allegiance to Islamic State militants and preparing to launch an attack on policemen or soldiers on the streets of London.

The four, who were arrested over the past two weeks, are variously charged with obtaining a handgun and conducting ¡°hostile reconnaissance¡± of Shepherd¡¯s Bush police station in west London and the nearby White City reservist army barracks. Further charges include storing images sent via photo-sharing service Instagram of two police officers and of two civilian police community support officers.

¡°This is a plot, in essence, to shoot, to kill, police officers or soldiers on the streets of London,¡± prosecutor Mark Dawson told Westminster Magistrates¡¯ Court.

Tarik Hassane, 21; Suhaib Majeed, 20; Nyall Hamlett, 24; and Momen Motasim, 21, all from the London area, were remanded in custody after a brief hearing to appear at the Old Bailey court on Oct. 27. They have yet to enter a plea. A fifth man, Nathan Cuffy, 25, also from London, was remanded in custody on firearms offences.

BRITAIN: A 14TH-CENTURY TREASON LAW REVISITED

Britain may use a medieval law dating to 1351 to charge citizens with treason if they go to fight with Islamic State insurgents in Iraq and Syria, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said.

Security officials say some 500 Britons ? largely with Muslim immigrant backgrounds ? are believed to be fighting in Iraq and Syria, though the true figure could be much greater and security officials worry that those who return could carry out an attack on Britain.

Hammond said any British citizen who had sworn personal allegiance to Islamic State could have committed an offense under the Treason Act of 1351, passed during the reign of England¡¯s King Edward III. The maximum sentence for treason in Britain is life imprisonment. It was death until 1998.

The last person to be hanged for treason in Britain was William Joyce, a propagandist for Nazi Germany nicknamed Lord Haw Haw who broadcast to Britain during the Second World War and who was executed in 1946.

Bloomberg News reported Wednesday that Vice Media Inc. CEO Shane Smith sprung for the dinner following a lucky run at the casino¡¯s blackjack tables. Bloomberg said its source was a person who asked not to be identified because the meal was private.

On Tuesday, MGM Resorts International Chairman Jim Murren cited the dinner bill as an ¡°encouraging sign¡± that Las Vegas visitors were eager to spend money again.

168,"Get ready for the tech press to flip out when Apple announces the retail price for the gold Apple Watch Edition model. Apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be, and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers. But the ¡°18-karat gold¡± Apple Watch Edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of $10,000. The funny thing in this case is that Apple is perfectly right to be charging that much!

Do you disagree? Check out my counterpoint, ¡°The Case Against the $10,000 Gold Apple Watch Edition¡°

Gold is Expensive

Let¡¯s start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people don¡¯t understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.

Update: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit ¡°back of the envelope.¡± Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic¡¦

Here are the basic facts:

Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.
18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.
One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.
18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc.
.25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!

Gold Watches are Expensive

Let¡¯s apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But it¡¯s a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So let¡¯s just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 ? 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.

A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost over $8,300
A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200
Now let¡¯s consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. That¡¯s 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and you¡¯re still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.

How does this translate in the real world? Let¡¯s look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.

This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k gold
This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k gold
The Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k gold
Cartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 street
Cartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 street
The Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k gold
Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 street
Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 street
This list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, it¡¯s pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.

Then there¡¯s the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!

Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.

Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They can¡¯t price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.

The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000

There¡¯s a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmaker¡¯s gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!

Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. That¡¯s not going to happen. So they¡¯re likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.

First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.

Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, ¡°solid¡± in their press releases, they do claim it is ¡°crafted from 18-karat gold¡± and nowhere does it say it is plated or ¡°gold filled¡± (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.

Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, it¡¯s hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.

Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as ¡°standard gold¡±. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.

My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose it¡¯s possible with some finagling and if that¡¯s the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.

This is a $10,000 product
This is a $10,000 product
Bonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.

Update!

Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine I¡¯ll hear from lots of them real soon!

The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then there¡¯s the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX  (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.


I think this number is way too low, but it¡¯s a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think he¡¯s way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.

Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but it¡¯s much, much smaller than the Apple watch and it¡¯s circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and we¡¯re at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.

So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But let¡¯s take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So we¡¯re back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, ¡°If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.¡±

Regardless of the total, it¡¯s important to realize that the price of gold is in the driver¡¯s seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.

170,"Leading up to the somber anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, there are fresh fears of possible 9/11-style attacks taking place across North Africa as radical Islamist groups in Libya have reportedly seized nearly a dozen commercial airliners in the last month.

While counterterrorism officials are reportedly concerned that the missing jetliners could be used by terrorists to carry out deadly attacks, the timing of the theft is also setting off alarms. The concern is that radical Islamist groups will use the planes to mark the anniversary of the deadly 9/11 attacks, according to alleged intelligence reports disseminated within the U.S. government.

Reports that Islamist militias have seized the jetliners come just weeks before the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.
¡°There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing. ¡¦ We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes,¡± one official reportedly told the Washington Free Beacon.

The aircraft were reportedly stolen in August after Islamists took control of the Tripoli International Airport. It was later reported that 11 commercial jetliners were missing.

On Sept. 11, 2012, four Americans were killed during a terrorist attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya. At first, the Obama administration blamed the attack on a spontaneous protest over an anti-Muslim YouTube video.

171,"WASHINGTON ? A U.S. Republican senator and frequent Mideast traveler said Thursday that the Taliban detainees released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl have been in touch with members of the al-Qaida linked Haqqani network, yet all five still are being monitored in Qatar.

The Pentagon said Thursday that it is working with Qatar and is confident that any threat posed by the former detainees can be mitigated.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, who recently visited Qatar, said he had been afraid that one of the detainees had left the country but said he was assured during his visit that all five remain in the small Gulf nation.

Qatar gained public praise from President Barack Obama for brokering the controversial deal in May 2014 that freed Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban captivity in exchange for the release of the five senior Taliban officials who had been imprisoned for years at the U.S.-run Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba.

Qatar promised Obama it would keep the five under watch for one year, although they would then be free to leave.

""""It's just a year deal,"""" Graham told The Associated Press on Wednesday. """"Just as sure as we're sitting here, they're going back to the fight.""""

""""They've had some Haqqani people come to meet with them. ... They're reaching out. The Taliban five are communicating with people inside Afghanistan.""""

However, Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a leading Capitol Hill voice on foreign policy, said all five are still in Qatar.

""""I was afraid one had left, but they told me they're all still there,"""" he said.

The Pentagon said in a statement that it would not comment on specific cases involving the detainees.

""""However, we take any incidence of re-engagement very seriously, and we work in close coordination through military, intelligence, law enforcement and diplomatic channels to mitigate re-engagement and to take follow-on action when necessary,"""" the statement said. """"The Defense Department has a close security partnership with the government of Qatar. We're confident in our ability to continue to mitigate any threat that may be posed by the former Guantanamo detainees.""""

Haqqani operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and has been one of the deadliest threats to U.S. troops in the war. The network, which the State Department designated as a foreign terrorist organization in 2012, claims allegiance to the Afghan Taliban but operates with some degree of autonomy.

The five detainees released were:

Abdul Haq Wasiq, who served as the Taliban deputy minister of intelligence.
Mullah Norullah Nori, a senior Taliban commander in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif when the Taliban fought U.S. forces in late 2001.
Khairullah Khairkhwa, who served in various Taliban positions including interior minister and had direct ties to Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden.
Mohammed Nabi, who served as chief of security for the Taliban in Qalat, Afghanistan, and later worked as a radio operator for the Taliban's communications office in Kabul.
Mohammad Fazl, who Human Rights Watch says could be prosecuted for war crimes for presiding over the mass killing of Shiite Muslims in Afghanistan in 2000 and 2001 as the Taliban sought to consolidate their control over the country.

173,"Nicaraguan officials have appealed for witnesses to a meteorite strike that left a 12m-wide crater near Managua's international airport on Saturday night.

Residents reported a loud boom as the meteorite crashed but scientists said no one had come forward who had seen the streak that a speeding space rock would score across the sky.

""""I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast,"""" Jorge Santamaria told the Associated Press. """"We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave.""""

A government spokeswoman, Rosario Murillo, said a team formed to study the event believed the 5m-deep crater was left by a relatively small meteorite that appeared to have come off an asteroid passing close to Earth. She said international scientists had been called in to help with the investigation.

The meteorite may have been a fragment of a house-sized asteroid nicknamed Pitbull, which hurtled past Earth on Sunday night at a distance of 40,000km.

Dan Brown, an astronomer at Nottingham Trent University, said that although the Nicaraguan impact occurred 12 hours before Pitbull passed Earth, Central America was facing the right direction for the strike to be a fragment associated with the asteroid.

Pieces of the asteroid could have broken off during collisions with other rocks in the asteroid belt or through heating when the asteroid swung around the sun.

""""It certainly makes absolute sense that people surrounding the impact site heard a loud boom. But a flash of light or bright object should also have been observed before that,"""" Brown said.

Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies, told the AP it was unclear whether the meteorite disintegrated or was buried on impact at the site. The meteorite could have exploded in the air and produced a shockwave that made the crater, or struck the ground and left small fragments embedded in the soil.

Witness accounts of the meteorite strike would help scientists confirm when the meteorite struck and the path it took ? information that could link it to Pitbull or rule out the asteroid as the source of the rock. Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was strange no one had reported a streak of light. """"We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.""""

If investigators can find remnants of the meteorite in the crater, then its chemical makeup could be compared with measurements of the larger asteroid taken from ground-based telescopes.

""""It's a wake-up call that we need to understand more about the flight paths of asteroids,"""" Brown said."

Strange natural occurrences are happening in the world today. But nothing more magnificent than the one you might experience on January 4, 2015 if this story is true.

According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth¡¯s own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.

Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they do so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation.

The report comes from sources at Apple via French website iGen.fr. As MacRumors points out, the site has been reliable in the past, accurately reporting the dimensions of both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

The cost of the gold model, though; well, quite simply it depends on how much gold there is. We'll have to wait to find out, but such high pricing would indeed make it very much a luxury item.

185,"A photo provided by the Nicaraguan Army shows an impact crater made by a small meteorite in a wooded area near Managua's international airport. Photo: AP

Managua: A mysterious explosion that rocked Nicaragua's crowded capital Managua, creating a large crater, appears to have been caused by a small meteorite.

Amazingly, in a sprawling city of 1.2 million people, the impact near the international airport did not cause any known injuries, but it did leave a crater measuring 12 metres across and was felt throughout the capital late on Saturday night, local time.

Nicaraguan authorities believe it was a piece of the small asteroid dubbed """"2014 RC"""", which passed very close to Earth on Sunday and was estimated by astronomers to be about 20 metres wide, or the size of a house.

""""We are convinced that this was a meteorite. We have seen the crater from the impact,"""" said Wilfredo Strauss of the Seismic Institute.

The meteorite appeared to have hurtled into a wooded area near the airport around midnight and the hit was so large that it registered on the instruments Dr Strauss's organisation uses to measure earthquakes.

""""You can see two waves: first, a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth, and then another stronger one, which is the impact of the sound,"""" he said.

Government officials and experts visited the impact site on Sunday.

One of them, William Martinez, said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil.

""""You can see mirror-like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power-scraped the walls,"""" Dr Martinez said.

People who live near the crater told local media they heard a blast they took for an explosion, and that liquid, sand and dust were blown through the air, which smelled like something had burned.

Nicaragua has more than 20 volcanoes and is regularly shaken by earthquakes, so many locals initially thought a quake caused the loud bang.

There were no reported injuries because the impact was in a wooded spot, and flights at the airport were not affected.

NASA said last week that the asteroid 2014 RC, at the time of closest approach, would be about one-tenth the distance from the centre of Earth to the moon, or about 40,000 kilometres.

It had been projected to be roughly over New Zealand at the time of its closest approach, which astronomers had calculated would be on Sunday about 1818 GMT (4.18am on Monday AEST).

The 12-second audio begins with a man seemingly leaving a message for someone on an adult video service.

Six shots fired in rapid succession are heard in the background. After a two second pause, another four or five shots ring out.

Lopa Blumenthal, the unnamed man¡¯s attorney, told CNN that her client has been interviewed by the FBI.

¡°At the time he didn¡¯t even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards,¡± Blumenthal said. ¡°It just happened to have captured twelve seconds of what transpired outside of his building.¡±

While it is difficult to clearly make out whether 10 or 11 shots are fired, Blumenthal told CNN she believes she heard 11.

Details surrounding the recording are unclear, including why it is emerging over two weeks after the shooting.

It is also unclear at what point the man began recording the message that captured the gun shots. Witnesses as well as law enforcement officials have said that Wilson fired one and perhaps two isolated shots in his police cruiser before numerous shots were fired outside of the car. The new audio seemingly does not capture the one or two shots fired inside Wilson¡¯s cruiser.

Wilson has reportedly claimed that the gun went off in the cruiser during an altercation with Brown in which the 18-year-old shoved him into the car, assaulted him, and struggled to grab the weapon.

After the altercation in the car, witnesses say that Brown fled. From there, Brown¡¯s movements and Wilson¡¯s response are also unclear.

Wilson reportedly claims that after pursuing Brown, the man turned around to face him, taunted him and then began charging before Wilson fired the fatal shots.

Some witnesses say that Wilson began shooting after Brown fled. At that point Brown turned around in order to surrender but Wilson continued firing the fatal shots anyway, the witnesses said.

In a press conference shortly after the shooting, St. Louis County police chief Jon Belmar said that Wilson fired ¡°more than just a couple [of shots]¡± but provided no further detail.

According to a CNN report filed days after the shooting, witnesses claimed that they heard up to 10 shots. Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown¡¯s who was with him during the shooting, told of only a few.

A medical examiner who performed a private autopsy on Brown determined that he was shot at least six times. He had eight wounds on his body, but two may have been re-entry wounds.

It was initially reported that the altercation and shooting followed an argument after Wilson ordered Brown and Johnson to get out of the middle of the road. But it later emerged that Brown had stolen cigars and shoved a store clerk just minutes before he encountered Wilson. Wilson reportedly says that seconds after their first encounter, he received the police dispatch call reporting the strong-arm robbery and then doubled-back to confront the two.

187,"A jilted lover has chopped off his own penis after he was dumped by his girlfriend.

Oliver Ilic, 22, was told that he was no good in bed so it is claimed he mutilated himself then threw the remains in the bin.

He is alleged to have told doctors that he had a small appendage and cited that as the reason why his girlfriend was no use to him.

Ilic contacted emergency services when he could not stop the bleeding and was taken to hospital in the east Macedonian town town of Kocani.

Police searched his house and discovered the severed organ in a bin after it had been cut off with a single swipe from a razor blade which was also lying in the bin.

Doctors were initially unable to re-attach his penis but he was then transferred to the capital, Skopje, where it was reunited with his body following five hours of surgery.

However they said it was still too early to know if the operation would be a success and if it would ever function properly again.

The Po River and Delta are known for massive wels catfish, but anything bigger than 6.5 feet is considered extremely rare, and this one measured 8.8 feet.

The U.K. Mirror reported that Ferrari¡¯s fish could possibly be the world¡¯s biggest wels catfish caught with a rod and reel, though records of this sort are difficult to confirm.

The Mirror and NT News reported that the biggest wels catfish ever recorded was a 9.1-footer from the Po Delta, but they differ on its weight?one reporting it as 308 pounds, the other as 317 pounds. The method of that catch is uncertain.

Sportex Italia, Ferrari¡¯s sponsor, called his fish the ¡°world record spinning torpedo,¡± which might mean it¡¯s a world record for a Torpedo spinning rod made by an Italian manufacturer, though it also simply says it¡¯s a ¡°world record in the spin fishing for catfish.¡±

Regardless, Ferrari¡¯s fish is one of the biggest wels catfish recorded in recent history.

The wels catfish is the second-largest freshwater fish in its region, ranking behind the beluga sturgeon. The largest beluga sturgeon on record is reportedly 3,463 pounds.

Ferrari told GrindTV that the fish took an artificial bait on the surface, and the fight from a boat lasted 40 minutes.

The best part about Ferrari¡¯s catch is that after he and his brother, Dario, weighed the fish, they released it back into the delta so it could fight again another day.

189,"Islamist militias in Libya have reportedly taken control of 11 commercial aircraft from Tripoli International Airport in Libya, sparking fears of a 9/11-style terrorattack.

Ahead of the 13th anniversary of the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington, reports emerged that Islamist militias took control of nearly a dozen jetliners last month after the airport was the scene of a fierce battle.

On Sunday, the Libyan government announced that they had lost control of the capital to the militants, who include the Islamic groups Ansar al Sharia - which has ties to the Islamic State - and Libyan Dawn, an umbrella group for Islamist militias.

The country is currently witnessing its worst spasm of violence since former dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed in 2011. Intelligence officials have been told in the last two weeks of the possibility that one of more of the aircraft could be used in an attack later this month, according to the Washington Free-Beacon.

""""There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,"""" one official told the Free-Beacon. """"We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.""""

Damaged airplanes on the tarmac at Tripoli international airport

September 11 not only marks the anniversary of the World Trade Centre and Pentagon attacks; it will also be the second anniversary of the Islamic militant-led raid of the US Ambassador's compound in Benghazi, Libya when four Americans, including US Ambassador Christopher Stevens, were killed.

In July 2014 fighting broke out in the area of Tripoli International Airport, Libya as anti-government and pro-government militias were engaged in fighting. As a result, Tripoli Airport was closed for air traffic and many aircraft were damaged as result of the devastating fighting.

Al Jazeera reported that the planes are now being held by a group called the Masked Men Brigade who plan to use them in terror attacks.

Moroccan military expert Abderrahmane Mekkaoui told Al Jazeera there is """"credible intelligence"""" that the Masked Men Brigade """"is plotting to use the planes in attacks on the Maghreb state' on the 9/11 anniversary.""""

A commander for the Libyan Dawn group said earlier this week his forces had entered and been in control of the US Embassy compound in Libya's capital since last week.

A video posted online showed men playing in a pool at the compound. In a message on Twitter, US Ambassador to Libya Safira Deborah said the video appeared to have been shot in at the embassy's residential annex."

LAST UPDATED AT 14:41 ON Tue 10 Feb 2015
Unconfirmed reports from Movie Pilot and Ikwiz suggest that director JJ Abrams wants to bring forward the release of the hotly anticipated forthcoming Star Wars film, Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens, to this summer.

The rumour comes from an industry event ? the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015 ? where Abrams is said to have told attendees he was frustrated with the slow drip of leaks from the set.

According to Movie Pilot, Abrams is worried that the leaked images and plot details will """"ruin"""" the film before it gets to fans. Ikwiz says: """"Disney is reportedly taking Abrams's request very seriously, and is looking at a possible summer release.""""

The film has been scheduled for release in December this year ? with the next two instalments in the series following in 2017 and 2019, according to Disney boss Bob Iger.

Releasing The Force Awakens in the summer would be """"an extremely brave move"""" says Movie Pilot, as it would put the latest Star Wars up against box office heavyweights including Avengers 2: Age Of Ultron, Ant-Man and the long-awaited Jurassic World."

200,"Breitbart Texas reports:

An Islamic Tribunal using Sharia law in Texas has been confirmed by Breitbart Texas. The tribunal is operating as a non-profit organization in Dallas. One of the attorneys for the tribunal said participation and acceptance of the tribunal¡¯s decisions are ¡°voluntary.¡±

Breitbart Texas spoke with one of the ¡°judges,¡± Dr. Taher El-badawi. He said the tribunal operates under Sharia law as a form of ¡°non-binding dispute resolution.¡± El-badawi said their organization is ¡°a tribunal, not arbitration.¡± A tribunal is defined by Meriam-Webster¡¯s Dictionary as ¡°a court or forum of justice.¡± The four Islamic attorneys call themselves ¡°judges¡± not ¡°arbitrators.¡±

El-badawi said the tribunal follows Sharia law to resolve civil disputes in family and business matters. He said they also resolve workplace disputes.

In matters of divorce, El-badawi said that ¡°while participation in the tribunal is voluntary, a married couple cannot be considered divorced by the Islamic community unless it is granted by the tribunal.¡± He compared their divorce, known as ¡°Talaq,¡± as something similar to the Catholic practice of annulment in that the church does not recognize civil divorce proceedings as ending a marriage.

An Examiner.com article seems troubled by this.

This, though, is a perfectly normal practice within religious groups in America. El-badawi is right that Catholics have long gone to Catholic authorities to resolve certain questions related to marriage. Orthodox Jews have long gone to Jewish religious courts (such a court is called a ¡°beth din¡±) both to resolve marital matters and to resolve commercial disputes. Some Protestants sometimes do the same; 1 Corinthians 6:1 is often interpreted as calling for that.

There are three ways in which these tribunals¡¯ decisions have practical effect.

1. Parties¡¯ respect for the system: Religious people may often feel personally obligated to follow the judgments of respected authorities on their religious law. For instance, a Catholic who doesn¡¯t get an annulment might feel obligated not to remarry, even if he thinks that he should have gotten the annulment, simply because he feels that God wants him to follow the church¡¯s teachings and decisions.

2. Social pressure: Would observant Muslims feel pressured to abide by a sharia tribunal¡¯s ruling, when that will affect how their coreligionists, business partners, neighbors, and family members perceive them? You bet. Would Orthodox Jews feel the same? You bet, and I expect that Christians who operate within sufficiently devout and religiously homogeneous communities would have the same reaction. For an interesting, but rare, case of the legal system being asked to intervene to stop such social pressure and refusing to do so, see Paul v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc¡¯y (9th Cir. 1987). (I think that, even in the absence of the Free Exercise Clause that were made in that case, but that might be unavailable in many states following Employment Division v. Smith (1990), a campaign urging people to shun the excommunicated would be protected under the Free Speech Clause, see NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co. (1982).)

Indeed, one common argument in favor of religiosity is that community pressure tends to lead people to abide by religious obligations (not to steal, not to commit adultery, and more). The flip side is that community pressure tends to lead people to abide by religious obligations that we might not agree with (stay with a husband who mistreats you, never remarry, and so on). Of course, if there is also the threat of violence and not just community pressure, then the law can step in to punish the violence, and any explicit threats of violence. But the possibility of such violence in rare cases doesn¡¯t allow the legal system to step in to block nonviolent social pressure in other cases.

3. The parties could also enter into a binding arbitration agreement, under which they agree that the tribunal¡¯s decision would be enforceable in civil court. Such agreements are common with secular commercial arbitration, even when the arbitration is supposed to apply law other than American law (e.g., English law or French law). And they are also permissible for religious arbitration.

There are interesting questions about whether an arbitral decision is enforceable in secular American court if it applies substantive or procedural rules that discriminate based on race, religion or sex. I discuss this a bit in this post, and the comments to it are also much worth reading. But according to the Breitbart Texas article, El-badawi says that these tribunals do not conduct legally binding arbitrations; rather, their decisions are followed ? when they are followed ? as a result of the parties¡¯ acquiescence and community pressure. As a result, these interesting questions don¡¯t arise here.

Religious communities have long had the right to use standard American contract law ? coupled with the standard American liberty to exert social pressure on your family members, friends, neighbors and business partners ? to have religious decisionmakers decide disputes. That¡¯s especially so when the decisions are enforced just by community members¡¯ own religious feelings, or by social pressure. But that can also be so, subject to some limitations, when the parties to the dispute agree to binding arbitration (which, again, doesn¡¯t seem to be in play with the Texas Islamic tribunal).

The remedy for those who disapprove of the religious law is leaving the community (or the religion). That is of course often very hard, for personal and economic reasons. It¡¯s hard for Muslims. It¡¯s hard for Orthodox Jews (and especially groups such as the Satmar Hasidim). It¡¯s hard for Mormons, Jehovah¡¯s Witnesses, the Amish, and members of lots of other groups. But that¡¯s a necessary aspect of American social and religious freedom."

205,"New York (CNN) -- When war reporter James Foley wasn't writing for GlobalPost or recording video for AFP or appearing on the PBS """"NewsHour,"""" he occasionally shared stories on his own blog, aptly titled """"A World of Troubles.""""

For a subtitle, he chose the famous Carl von Clausewitz sentence """"War is fought by human beings.""""

And that is exactly what Foley sought to show with his reporting: humanity amid the horror of war.

Foley was abducted while on a reporting trip in northern Syria in November 2012. He was never heard from again.

A video published Tuesday by the extremist group ISIS showed Foley being beheaded. It is not known when or where the video was recorded.

For Foley's family and friends, the recording was the answer they hoped they'd never hear to their questions about his disappearance.

""""We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people,"""" his mother, Diane, said Tuesday night,

She called him """"an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person.""""

Courageous, generous

Foley was the oldest child of Diane and John Foley of Rochester, New Hampshire. He had four siblings.

Foley -- Jim to his friends -- had been reporting from war-torn countries for the better part of four years when he disappeared in Syria.

On Tuesday, fellow journalists remembered him for his courage and his generosity.

One of his friends, Alex Sherman of Bloomberg News, wrote on Twitter that he was a """"funny, warm, Big Lebowski-loving guy.""""

Another friend, Max Fisher of Vox, praised his """"dedication to truth and understanding.""""

Fisher also wrote that """"Jim's faith was something we all agreed not to discuss publicly while he was held in Syria, but it was the wellspring of his generosity,""""

He recalled how Foley helped to organize a memorial fund for a photographer, Anton Hammerl, who was killed in Libya in 2011.

Foley had been traveling with Hammerl and two other journalists at the time, and the three who survived wound up in a Libyan jail.

Beheading of American journalist James Foley recalls past horrors

Front-line journalist

Foley was freed six weeks later. Afterward, in a video interview with the Boston Globe, he hesitated to make the story about himself, remarking at one point that """"you don't want to be defined as 'that guy who got captured in 2011.'""""

""""I believe that front-line journalism is important, you know -- without these photos and videos and first-hand experience, we can't really tell the world how bad it might be,"""" he said.

One of the journalists detained with Foley in Libya, Clare Morgana Gillis, said his fundraising for Hammerl's family was """"the same impulse that compelled him to cut short his much-needed break from reporting in Syria when a colleague went missing last summer, and to raise money for an ambulance for Aleppo's Dar al-Shifa field hospital, where he spent weeks filming the plight of doctors who struggled to save lives with minimal space equipment.""""

His time as a teacher

For Foley, these were acts of service, not entirely unlike his time spent in the Teach for America program. He began teaching in Phoenix in 1996.

""""He'd promise students that he'd take them to the Castles and Coasters amusement park if they would come to class everyday,"""" a fellow Teach for America alum, Sarah Fang, recalled in an essay in 2013.

Foley later """"taught reading and writing to inmates at the Cook County Sheriff's Boot Camp in Chicago,"""" according to a Columbia Journalism Review feature about him.

Would you watch the video?

His journalism career

In the mid-2000s he decided to pursue a journalism career, first by enrolling at Northwestern University's well-respected Medill School of Journalism and then by embedding with American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. While preparing for his first embed, he started his blog.

Foley freelanced for a number of news media outlets, including GlobalPost, a world news Web site founded in 2009.

In 2012, he gravitated toward the spiraling conflict in Syria.

Fang, who kept in touch with Foley after their years teaching in Phoenix, wrote that his interest in the story there did not surprise her.

""""He's always been willing to step into a zone where no one else wants to go,"""" she wrote. """"Jim feels that society needs reporters willing to bear witness and report back the facts of history-in-the-making. And his loyalty to his colleagues meant that he wanted to be there with them on the frontlines.""""

BuzzFeed Middle East correspondent Sheera Frenkel said she last saw Foley about a week before his final trip into Syria.

Drinking beers at the lobby of a hotel popular among journalists, they talked, she said, about """"how hard it was to move on from this job, into a life which would allow for marriage and family.""""

""""He was a generous colleague, never holding back a tip, phone number, or detail that could help, and could spend hours talking over the ins and outs of a story to get it just right,"""" Frenkel wrote in an email message.

""""Jim was a great journalist, and I think he'd like to be remembered that way, first and foremost.""""

After the news of Foley's killing spread on Tuesday, CBS News foreign correspondent Clarissa Ward changed her profile picture on Twitter to a photo of Foley wearing a helmet, a flak jacket and holding up a camera.

This, she said, """"is how I will chose to remember James -- as a brave and tireless journalist with a passion for the Syrian cause.""""

209,"A Taliban commander exchanged for the release of a POW attempts to return to the battlefield, raising questions about closing Guantanamo

When U.S. President Barack Obama agreed in May to exchange five Taliban detainees from Guantanamo Bay for Bowe Bergdahl, a U.S. soldier who had been held captive for five years, his political opponents had a field day. They warned that the detainees risked returning to Afghanistan, and to militancy. Obama, with the backing of the government of Qatar that had agreed to host the men, promised that they would be kept far from the battlefield. Seems that the men may have had other ideas. According to CNN, U.S. military and intelligence officials now suspect that at least one of the detainees has made contact with Taliban associates in Afghanistan, suggesting that he, and perhaps the others, may be planning a return.

Considering that 29 percent of all U.S. detainees who were held in the Guantanamo detention center are either suspected of or confirmed to have returned to the fight, according to a March 2015 assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, it shouldn¡¯t be all that surprising. TIME¡¯s Massimo Calabresi predicted as much back in June, just after Bergdahl was released. The recidivism rate, he wrote, ¡°suggests that statistically at least one of the Taliban leaders will return to the field to fight Americans in Afghanistan, or elsewhere.¡±

At the time of the exchange, Taliban commanders who had been involved in Bergdahl¡¯s capture, captivity and release, told TIME that the exchange ? five of theirs for one of America¡¯s ? would encourage them to seek out more P.O.W.s. So far, that hasn¡¯t happened. It¡¯s not clear which of the five former detainees was reaching out to associates in Afghanistan, but as high-ranking commanders and former comrades-in-arms of Taliban leader Mullah Omar, any one of them could galvanize a movement that is slowly making gains in the wake of the U.S. drawdown in Afghanistan. Even if those plans have now been foiled, the incident may have one other far reaching consequence: as Obama attempts to close down Guantanamo for good, his opponents now have more ammunition for why he should not.

210,"Hailed as a hero: Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers. Photo: Reuters

Ottawa: As Canada comes to terms with finding itself in the firing line of militant Islamists it turned for reassurance to a 58-year-old former Mountie formerly best known for carrying a golden mace.

As parliament's sergeant-at-arms, Kevin Vickers' role is largely ceremonial, symbolising the authority of the body and keeping order in the chamber wearing a bicorne hat and tail coat.

But on Wednesday, when a lone Islamist gunman stormed the building, he put pomp and circumstance to one side, found a gun and fired the shots that brought the rampage to an end.

He was back in the chamber on Thursday, a humble hero at the centre of attention, applauded to the rafters by members of parliament.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper crossed the floor to shake his hand. Opposition leader Tom Mulcair praised his """"heroism"""".

Mr Vickers took charge of security on Parliament Hill - a collection of government buildings overlooking the Ottawa River - in 2006, after a 29-year career in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

He was an experienced officer, reaching the rank of chief superintendent, but he is not usually armed.

So when Michael Zehaf-Bibeau charged through the front doors of parliament he reportedly had to return to his office to open the lockbox where he kept his handgun.

The attacker had already shot a security guard in the leg in an exchange of gunfire and had run down the Hall of Honour towards the library, where he took cover in an alcove next to Mr Vickers' office.

Mr Vickers reportedly emerged, threw himself to the ground to present a smaller target, and shot the assailant three times.

It was the first time he had ever shot anyone, a family member told local media.

""""He always put his nation and his community first and foremost,"""" his brother John said.

A letter that supposedly accompanied Lego boxes in 1974 has been making the rounds on the Internet this week. The letter reminds parents that """"the urge to create is equally strong in all children...boys and girls."""" Take a look:


Source: Imgur
The letter was first posted by Reddit user fryd_, who said he unearthed the letter """"with his niece and nephew at their Grandma's house"""" in a box with a """"blonde girl on the front with a white Lego house.""""

If real, this letter perfectly aligns with Lego's history of egalitarian advertising that hasn't pigeonholed its products to just boys.

But like everything on the Internet, the legitimacy is being questioned. The writers at iO9 are less skeptical, pointing to the letter's use of Lego's 1970s logo, which is slightly different than the one used presently. As for further evidence for authenticity, Lego's ads in that era used similar fonts. Lastly, there's a German version of the letter that reads almost identical to this one.

The evidence is convincing that it's legitimate and it would be a bizarre thing to fake. It's a compelling statement to make for the 1970s ? and more importantly, it still holds true today.

214,"Angry locals came to the teenager's aid after hearing her scream, before then dragging the man to a butchers shop

An Indian man accused of trying to rape a teenager reportedly had his penis lopped off by vigilante locals after they allegedly heard the girl¡¯s screams.

Suresh Kumar, 40, is now recovering in hospital after he was apparently dragged into a butchers shop in the city of Ganganagar, in India¡¯s Rajasthan state.

He had allegedly been seen pinning the petrified girl to a wall, which is when he was pulled off and taken to a store to have his genitals hacked off with a meat cleaver.

The appendage was reportedly thrown into the road, with officers now hunting down the perpetrators. He is understood to be in a critical condition, while the girl was treat for shock.

Aamir Dhawan, 30, a local, said: ¡°No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime,¡± according to the Daily Mirror.

He added: ¡°We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it¡¯s time it stopped.

¡°This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.¡±

The Daily Mail reports a police spokesperson as saying: ¡°As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice.

¡°We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.¡±

The Indian government has been accused of not doing enough to protect its citizens, as violent attacks against girls and women become increasingly condemned by the international community.

Meenakshi Ganguly , South Asia Director at Human Rights Watch, wrote in the Hindustan Times in August that ¡°knee-jerk solutions like death penalty for rapists and lowering the age of a juvenile from 18 to 16 will not help end sexual violence against women.¡±

She added: ¡°Instead of hasty measures, the government should make a commitment to effective law enforcement and the more difficult and lengthy steps needed to reform the criminal justice system.¡±

Recent incidents include a 15-year-old teenage girl who was gang-raped and murdered in India in September, and a six-year-old girl who was raped at a school in Bangalore in July."
217,"International experts have raised doubts as to whether a 12m-wide (40ft) crater near the Nicaraguan capital, Managua, was caused by a meteorite.

Nicaraguan officials announced on Sunday that a """"small meteorite"""" had come down near the airport.

But Nasa scientists say the fact that no-one reported seeing a fireball in the sky would suggest it was caused by something else.

So far no meteorite fragments have been found in the crater.

'Like a bomb'

Locals said they heard a large blast just before midnight local time on Saturday and reported a burning smell.

A crater 12m wide and more than 5m deep was later found near Managua's international airport.

An adviser to Nicaragua's Institute of Earth Studies (Ineter), Wilfried Strauch, said he was """"convinced it was a meteorite"""" which caused the impact.

But Head of Nasa's Meteoroid Environment Office Bill Cooke said that """"for something to produce a hole in the ground that big, it would have generated a very bright fireball, and nothing was reported"""".

Managua has a population of 1.2 million people and many residents reported hearing a loud bang and feeling a shock wave.

Victor Gutierrez, a mechanic who lives less than a kilometre from the site of the crater said that he """"heard the explosion and felt the shockwave, which was very strong''.`

But he stressed that he """"didn't see anything in the sky either before or after.""""

Jaime Incer, a scientist who advises the Nicaraguan presidency on environmental matters, said it was possible nobody was looking up at the sky when the event took place close to midnight.

'Alternative explanations'

Nasa's Bill Cooke estimated that the crater would have been created by a blast of """"roughly the energy equivalent of 1 tonne of TNT [explosive material]"""".

In his blog on the NASA website, he said that a meteor capable of such force would have created a fireball visible over a wide area.

On Sunday Ineter scientist Jose Millan had insisted that """"all the evidence that we've confirmed at the site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event"""".

""""We have the seismic register which coincides with the time of impact, and the typical characteristic that it produces a cone in the place of impact,"""" he added.

Government spokeswoman and First Lady Rosario Murillo said the crater was created by a """"relatively small meteorite"""" that """"appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth"""".

But Nasa asteroid expert Don Yeomans said the impact felt in Managua """"was separated by 13 hours from the close Earth approach of [asteroid] 2014 RC, so the explosion and the asteroid are unrelated"""".

Mr Cooke said there could be any number of alternative explanations, ranging from ordinance to """"someone out blowing things up"""".

Nicaraguan officials said on Sunday that they would invite international experts to investigate the event further."
218,"The leader of the Catholic Church has assured pet lovers across the world that dogs do go to heaven.

Speaking at his weekly address in the Vatican's St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis confirmed that there is a place in heaven for our furry friends, along with 'all of God's creatures.'

The head of the Catholic Church had been attempting to console a distraught young boy who was mourning the death of his dog, according to Time magazine.

Pope Francis confirmed that there is a place in heaven for dogs and 'all of God's creatures' during his weekly address in the Vatican's St. Peter's Square

The statement is at odds with conservative Roman Catholic theology which states that animals cannot go to heaven because they have no souls.

Francis was quoted by Italian news media as saying: 'One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God's creatures.'

The remarks have been warmly welcomed by animal rights groups such as PETA and the Humane Society.

The issue of whether animals have the chance of an afterlife has been debated for centuries.

Pet owners will welcome the Pope's remarks that their beloved dogs, cats, horses and other furry friends have a place in heaven

Pope Francis has refused to meet the Dalai Lama over fears it could impact on the Catholic Church's relationship with China.

The exiled Tibetan leader requested the meeting during a visit to Rome but it was declined 'for obvious reasons concerning the delicate situation' with China.

The Catholic Church in China is divided in two; the official Church overseen by the Chinese Communist Party, and an underground community that swears allegiance to the Pope.

But the main bone of contention is over which side should have the final say in the appointment of bishops.

A Vatican official said the Pope's decision was 'not taken out of fear but to avoid any suffering by those who have already suffered'.

The longest serving Pope - Pius IX - who was the leader of the church from 1846 to 1878 believed animals had no consciousness and therefore could not have an afterlife.

Pope Francis's predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, had also denied the idea of pets entering heaven and said their death simply meant the end of their existence on Earth

But it is perhaps unsurprising that Pope Francis, aged 77, supports the idea of pets and animals having a place in paradise as he took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals.

It's not the first time Francis, an Argentine Jesuit who took over from Pope Benedict XVI last year, has courted controversy.

The leader is seen as more liberal than his predecessors and his lenient positions on homosexuality and unwed couples have caused a stir in the conservative members of the church."
219,"Syrian activists claim militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) seized earlier this week a cache of weapons airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces that were meant to supply Kurdish fighters battling the extremist group.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the militants seized at least once cache, but may have seized more, the Associated Press reported.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to ISIS, the agency said.

The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event.

The Observatory, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobane that lies near the Turkish border.

The militant group has been trying to seize the town for more than a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

 
(Photo courtesy: YouTube screengrab)

 

On Tuesday, ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said, ¡°Team USA.¡±

But the badly-aimed weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The ISIS militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people on Tuesday.

 
(Photo courtesy: YouTube screengrab)

 

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees (LCC) and the Britain-based Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The air strikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamist rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting air strikes against ISIS militants elsewhere in Syria.

220,"FORT DEVENS, Massachusetts -

Infamous Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, was the victim of an ¡°unfortunate accident¡± yesterday at Ft. Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts, just weeks after his high-profile trial began, according to warden Paul Jacobson.

Corrections officers reportedly found the alleged terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell; a banana peel was found on the floor nearby.

¡°It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times. There was blood everywhere ? all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet. The injuries have caused massive brain trauma,¡± said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith. ¡°We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall. Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev.¡±

¡°Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber,¡± said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens. ¡°The other gangs, they wanted him, too. We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do. On the way out, they shook our hands, told us ¡®Thank you.¡¯ Well, You¡¯re welcome. You¡¯re welcome, Boston. You¡¯re welcome, America!¡±

¡°Normally, an attack this violent, this cruel, on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence,¡± said warden Jacobson. ¡°Because of the nature of Tsarnaev¡¯s crimes, though, we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved. They have done our prison and our country a great service, and we appreciate it immensely. They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution, but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.¡±

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev were both suspected of perpetrating the Boston Marathon bombings on April 15, 2013. The bombings killed three people and reportedly injured as many as 264 others. Shortly after the FBI named the two suspects and released images of them, the two brothers reportedly killed an MIT police officer and carjacked an SUV in a shootout with police. During the shootout, the elder brother, Tamerlan was captured but was killed when his brother drove over him with the SUV. On the evening of April 20, 2013, the wounded Dzhokhar was found unarmed and hiding in a boat on a trailer in Watertown, Massachusetts.

On January 30, 2014, United States Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the federal government would seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev. The trial had just begun on January 5, 2015, as Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him."
221,"Updated at 11:45 p.m. ET

There was an unexpected crash landing near the international airport in the Nicaraguan capital over the weekend, but luckily no one was hurt: A small meteor, thought to have broken off from an Earth-passing asteroid, left a 40-foot-wide crater.

The meteorite ? which experts say may have disintegrated on impact ? smashed through a wooded area outside the airport in Managua, leaving a 16-foot-deep hole.

""""We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,"""" Jorge Santamaria, a resident in the area of the impact, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying.

The AP quotes Nicaraguan government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo as saying the meteorite was relatively small and """"appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.""""

Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened, the AP says.

""""All the evidence that we've confirmed at the site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event,"""" Ineter scientist Jose Millan was quoted by the BBC as saying. """"We have the seismic register which coincides with the time of impact, and the typical characteristic that it produces a cone in the place of impact.""""

According to the BBC:

The asteroid was discovered on Aug. 31 by the Catalina Sky Survey near Tucson, Ariz., and independently detected the next night by the Pan-STARRS 1 telescope, located on the summit of Haleakala on Maui, Hawaii, according to a NASA statement issued last week.

The statement said that on closest approach, the asteroid was to have been one-tenth the distance from the center of the Earth to the moon, or about 25,000 miles, away."
224,"A bunch ate through the ceiling of a sports editor's office and crawled all over his desk and left poops on his keyboard'

Not everyone at magazine publisher Cond? Nast was thrilled on hearing the company was going to become the new flagship tenant of the brand new World Trade Centre skyscraper where the Twin Towers once stood. Some felt spooked by the tragic history of the site. They didn¡¯t reckon on rats.

But one month after decamping from their old HQ off Times Square, the glamorous crews of titles like Vogue and Vanity Fair are waging a daily battle against a positive rat rampage. All employees have been banned from eating at their desks for fear of dispensing inadvertent treats to the roaming rodents.

Sources have told the Daily News that Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who likes a world of red carpets and sparkle not droppings and thick tails vanishing into cracks, has refused to show up in her office until the problem is bought under control.

While rat sightings are common in New York City¡¯s ageing subway system, few would have imagined their invading a building as brand new and prestigious as One World Trade. But there they are, it seems, in ever multiplying numbers, happily scaling what is now the tallest building in the Western hemisphere.

""""A bunch ate through the ceiling of a sports editor's office and crawled all over his desk and left poops on his keyboard,"""" one company source told the Daily News. """"They ate through his rug to fit under his door."""" Another disgusted staff member told the paper that the rats at Vogue had essentially ¡°taken over¡±.

It¡¯s not quite the start that Graydon Carter, Editor-in-Chief, had imagined either. Ambushed by a Daily News reporter outside the tower he was asked whether the rats were a disgusting as everyone has been saying. ¡°They¡¯re rats,¡± he replied. ¡°What do you think?¡±"
225,"The Indian government has sacked a civil servant who went on leave in 1990 and never came back to work.

Urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu said a case of """"wilful absence"""" had been proved against electrical engineer AK Verma.

Mr Verma had been under investigation since 1992, but had refused to co-operate, the minister said.

Correspondents say absenteeism is a pervasive problem in government-run offices in India.

Mr Naidu said in a statement that Mr Verma joined the Central Public Works Department in 1980.

He had risen to the rank of executive engineer by 1990, when he went on leave.

An inquiry was set up in 1992, but formal proceedings to dismiss him were not begun until 2007.

It took a further seven years for the department to reach a decision and dismiss him.

It is not clear whether he was paid during his time off.

Falling absenteeism

India's bureaucracy has become notorious for high levels of absenteeism.

A report in 2012 labelled India's government machinery the worst in Asia.

Schools have also faced problems, with teachers failing to turn up for work in huge numbers.

Last August, a state school in Madhya Pradesh sacked a teacher who had been absent for 23 years of her 24-year career.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised to curb slack working practices when he took office last year.

The AFP news agency reports that he makes unannounced visits to government offices, and absenteeism has since plummeted."
226,"WASHINGTON (AP) ? U.S. airstrikes earlier this week killed the leader of the al-Shabab terrorist group in Somalia, the Pentagon said Friday. President Barack Obama said the death of Ahmed Abdi Godane demonstrated U.S. counterterrorism resolve and was an example of his deliberate approach to dismantling al-Qaida affiliated groups.

The Pentagon's press secretary, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, announced the death in a brief written statement. It took the Pentagon four days to conclusively determine that Godane had not survived Monday's airstrikes.

Al-Shabab has not publicly confirmed Godane's death.

Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud urged al-Shabab militants to renounce violence, saying they have an opportunity to embrace peace following Godane's death.

""""While an extreme hardcore may fight over the leadership of al-Shabab, this is a chance for the majority of members of al-Shabab to change course and reject Godane's decision to make them the pawns of an international terror campaign,"""" he said in a statement.

The Somali president said the U.S. operation was carried out """"with the full knowledge and agreement of"""" his government and that Somalis """"greatly value the support of our international allies"""" in the fight against al-Shabab.

Obama, speaking at the conclusion of a NATO summit in Newport, Wales, told reporters the success against al-Shabab should leave no doubt about his determination to degrade and eventually destroy the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. military announced later Friday that a mix of fighter jets, drones, attack planes and bombers launched four airstrikes Thursday and Friday in northern Iraq, destroying a host of Islamic State targets including an observation post, an armed vehicle and three mortar positions.

Obama faces mounting pressure to take more aggressive military action against the Islamic State, which evolved from an al-Qaida affiliate that sprouted in Iraq in 2004.

""""We have been very systematic and methodical in going after these kinds of organizations"""" that threaten U.S. personnel and the homeland, Obama said. """"That deliberation allows us to do it right, but have no doubt: We will continue to do what is necessary to protect the American people.""""

U.S. officials had said after the strike on Monday that U.S. special operations forces using manned and drone aircraft had destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions. But they did not confirm that Godane had been killed until Friday.

The State Department declared al-Shabab a terrorist organization in February 2008. The implications of the group's loss of Godane are unclear.

""""The individual who takes his place will live in fear,"""" said Army Col. Steven Warren, a Pentagon spokesman.

Because Godane had weakened and effectively dismantled the al-Shabab council of leaders known as the shura, a meeting of regional commanders will have to take place to pick his successor, said Matt Bryden, the head of Sahan Research in Nairobi, Kenya. Bryden predicted the meeting will be difficult and dangerous to organize.

Terrorism analyst J.M. Berger predicted a significant splintering between al-Shabab's domestically focused insurgents and internationally aspiring terrorists.

Abdi Aynte, a Somali analyst who runs a Mogadishu-based think tank called the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies, predicted that Godane's death """"will almost certainly be the beginning of the end of the organization.""""

Under Godane's leadership, he said, al-Shabab had gradually become a guerrilla movement that avoided conventional warfare, tactics that suited it amid mounting military pressure from African Union troops and government forces.

Godane, who was born in 1977 and raised in the town of Hargeisa in the autonomous region of Somaliland, was said to be a quiet boy who was interested in the Quran and Islamic studies in his early years. His relatives there described him as """"a private man"""" who was devoted to Islamic teachings at mosques, said Mohamed Hassan, a former senior Somali intelligence official in Somaliland who once was tasked with tracking down Godane over charges the future terror leader stole money when he worked for a local telecommunications company. In Somaliland, he also had been accused of involvement in the murder of foreigners.

Godane is believed to have settled in Mogadishu in 2004, working at local charities before he joined the Islamic Courts Union, al-Shabab's precursor group that once controlled Mogadishu and many parts of Somalia before it was ousted by Ethiopian forces.

227,"LAGOS ? A wave of violence hours after Nigeria's government announced a truce with Boko Haram raised doubt on Sunday about whether more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the Islamist militants will really be released, deflating the new hopes of their parents.

Nigeria's armed forces chief Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh announced the ceasefire on Friday to enable the release of the girls, who were abducted from the remote northeastern village of Chibok in April.

But Boko Haram has not confirmed the truce and there have been at least five attacks since ? blamed by security sources on the insurgents ? that have killed dozens. Talks were scheduled to continue in neighboring Chad on Monday.

""""We were jubilating. We had every reason to be happy ... but since then the ceasefire has been broken in quite a number of places already,"""" Lawan Abana, a parent of the one of the missing girls, told Reuters by telephone.

He added that there were doubts about the credentials of the reported Boko Haram negotiator Danladi Ahmadu, who was unheard of before. """"Can we trust him that he can deliver on this promise of releasing the girls when he has not delivered on the promise of the ceasefire?"""" Abana said.

The government says the attacks may not have been Boko Haram but one of several criminal groups exploiting the chaos of its insurgency. Analysts point out that Boko Haram is anyway heavily factionalized, so what matters is whether the faction the government is talking to has control over the girls' fate.

228,"Sex-selecting abortions are nothing new. They happen all the time in China, for example. While they undoubtedly happen in the United States, people don¡¯t brag about them. At least they didn¡¯t.

It¡¯s hard to believe this is real, but according to the website ¡°Injustice Stories,¡± a woman named Lana, a self-described feminist, boasted of aborting her baby because it was a boy. Then, after making that declaration, claims to be shocked that some people might have a problem with that.

Lana, who only uses her first name, appears to be a child of privilege. She boasts of involvement in ¡°fighting for women¡¯s rights¡± being all-consuming, ¡°even to the point of eschewing a career.¡± Yet that lack of a career hasn¡¯t stopped her from travelling to ¡°many different places¡± to continue that ¡°fight.

She tells the story of a flight to an Occupy Wall Street event in San Francisco where she screamed ¡°Assault¡± because the man sitting next to her said ¡°B******* like you need to learn their place.¡±

Putting the unlikeliness of that exchange aside, Lana then demanded to be moved to another seat. That¡¯s when she was told the only empty seats were ¡°both back in economy.¡± At which point she demanded the man be moved.

When the flight attendants came running, one of whom was male, they refused to force the man to move because he hadn¡¯t done anything. Lana, regretfully, relented and, in tears, moved herself.

The encounter left her ¡°having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped.¡±

That flight, according to Lana, left her forever changed. ¡°By the time we landed, my outlook had changed, I could no longer depend on men to be an ally of the cause,¡± she wrote.

Lana was pregnant at the time, and thought she ¡°had a good idea¡± who the father, or as she puts it, ¡°the donator¡± happened to be. She was convinced she was having a girl because, well, she wanted a girl. Or at least a baby with a vagina, the ¡°gender¡± part would be up to the child. ¡°I had already started buying gender neutral clothing since I did not want outside influences affecting what gender she would ultimately become,¡± she writes.

After researching all-girl daycares and schools with the plan to make sure that ¡°No man will be around to hurt her progress, no boys there to demean her or call her names,¡± Lana got horrible news from her doctor ? her baby had a penis.

She spent the next two days in fit of crying rage. How could this happen to her? She says, ¡°My home became my prison and my fetus became my warden.¡±

Within a few days she had aborted the baby. ¡°My body¡¯s betrayal was no more, I was free, and for the first time since the airplane incident, I felt strong,¡± Lana claims. ¡°I had done something positive, something that would actually make a difference, something good.¡±

Lana informs readers that she is now the mother of ¡°a beautiful 1 year old female who will hopefully grow up to be just as strong and driven as her mother.¡±

She ends her post with:

I stand by my decision to abort my baby because it was a male.

I don¡¯t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn¡¯t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.

If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.

The backlash was immediate, and harsh. Lana, much to her shock, was on the receiving end of negative comments and even death threats.

At the request of the editors of the website, Lana returned to answer critics. She was as unrepentant the second time as she was the first."
229,"The highest paid 'performer' on You Tube, who is said to earn almost $5m a year unwrapping toys, is a former porn star called Sandy Summers, neighbours have told DailyMail.com.

Brazilian Daiane DeJeus was named by a family friend as the woman behind the wildly successful collection of children's videos that have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times.

And former neighbours of the mysterious internet star have revealed to Daily Mail.com her secret past - which could explain her desire to remain completely anonymous.

For years they knew her as Daiane DeJesus who lived in a suburban home with her long-term partner Messias Credido.

But they also discovered she was once a porn star called Sandy Summers.

Scroll down for video

Diane DeJesus in her porn star days (left) and at her local gas station in Orlando recently (right). The Brazilian has been named by neighbours as the woman behind the massively popular DC Toys Collector YouTube account

DeJesus' videos, in which a mysterious woman 'unboxes' toys while narrating as she does so, have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times on YouTube, bringing the 29-year-old an annual income of almost $5m

The Brazilian went by the name Sandy Summers but is now living under the name Daiane de Jesus

Are these the hands of DC Toys Collector? Daiane DeJesus and her husband are apparently behind the site that has become a YouTube sensation

Seen here with a Teletubbies toy, the woman's nails always appear differently in each DC Toys Collector video

The couple behind DC Toys Collector - previously known as 'Disney Collector' and one of the most popular videos on YouTube - has gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure their identities are not known.

Attempts by the New York Times and BuzzFeed website to establish their identity failed, though they were able to pinpoint Florida as the location of those behind the channel - which is nothing to do with Disney itself.

But Daily Mail.com has been told the identities of the pair by former neighbours and a close friend - and has used publicly available property records.

Former neighbours who listened to the videos of DC Toys Collector are convinced that DeJesus is the voice behind You Tube's most successful channel.

They became aware of her career as adult film star after she was spotted taking part in a photo shoot by the swimming pool in her back garden.

They also watched some of the graphic adult-only videos and instantly recognised the pouting young blonde as their suburban neighbour.

DeJesus, 32, never mentioned what she did for a living and the neighbours never asked.

Daily Mail.com tracked DeJesus, who quit the porn industry at least seven years ago, to her new home in an upscale gated community in Orlando, Florida.

Four people who were independently shown a photograph of DeJesus taken by Daily Mail.com this week and published here said that it was their former neighbour.

They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots.

One neighbour who listened to the DC Toys Collector video and said immediately: 'That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere.'

The neighbour, who declined to be named, said: 'Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to.

Maribel Barreto, an associate and ex-wife of Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido, was approached by Daily Mail.com and showed the photos of DeJesus and Summers. She said they are behind the DC Toys Collector videos

In the DC Toys Collector videos only the narrator's hands and the product being unboxed are usually seen

'Her husband said he ran a photographic business but he never left the house. That was strange.

'We just thought they were so secretive we thought something had to be going on.

'Then someone said we should look at Sandy Summers' website and it all clicked into place.'

His wife added: 'In the photo you have of Daiane she has put on a bit of weight but that is unmistakably her.

'That is our former neighbour. I used to chat with her quite a lot and was shocked when I learned what she did and what might have been going on at the house.'

Another neighbour, who is in his 70s and asked not be named, said no one in the quiet suburban street spoke to DeJesus or her husband about their work in the porn industry.

'We heard what they did but it was none of our business,' he said.

Credido's ex-wife Maribel Barreto was also approached by Daily Mail.com and viewed the photos of DeJesus and Summers.

When asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen-faced and hurried away.

'I have nothing to say,' she said as she sprinted into her apartment.

But Barreto, who was divorced in 2011, had earlier confirmed that her ex-husband and his wife Daiane ran the DC Toys Collector site from their home in Orlando.

She said: 'Yes, they are the Disney Collectors. I can't say any more.'

While DeJesus has done nothing illegal, many parents who allow their children to watch the videos might be dismayed to learn about the other graphic videos and photo shoots DC Toys Collector apparently took part in a decade ago.

Attempts by Daily Mail.com to speak with DeJesus and her husband have failed as they have no phone listing and they do not accept unsolicited callers to the gated community where they now live.

Neighbours in the upscale gated community confirmed that they know the blonde woman who lives with Messias Credido as Daiane DeJesus.

The couple, who have an 18 month old son, were married on December 26th 2013, according to records lodged with Seminole County Court.

Credido, who is also from Brazil, is behind another successful You Tube site called BluCollector.

It is identical to the DC Toys Collector channel except it focuses mainly on toys for young boys.

Both the BluCollector and the DC Toys Collector site are produced in exactly the same way.

Shipping receipts seen by Daily Mail.com show toys being sent from Germany to the home address of Credido.

Former neighbours in the Orlando suburb of Winter Springs where DeJesus and Credido lived said they would see deliveries from UPS and Fed Ex almost daily at their home.

'There would be delivery trucks up to three times a day. We all wondered what was going on and what was being dropped off,' said a neighbour.

Credido has been named as the man behind the Blu Collector by other media outlets.

But until now the identities behind DC Toys Collector have been a closely guarded secret.

The videos first began appearing on YouTube in 2012.

They quickly became an online sensation attracting millions of page views and popular with children aged three and under because of their simplicity.

The most watched video is called 'Play Doh Sparkle Princess' and has had more than 200 million views.

Five other videos have received more than 40 million views, and another 15 have more than 20 million.

The channel's 1,600 videos have been watched more than 2.4 billion times since being uploaded.

One of the most recent, called 'LUNCH BOX SURPRISE Magnetic Dress-Up FROZEN', has already notched up more than 260,000 page views.

The DC Toys Collector channel has more than 3.7m subscribers with a new video posted almost every day.

Like others on YouTube, DC Toys Collector is able to make money from the site from pop-up and banner adverts on the site.

With so many children watching the videos on a daily basis it is an obvious choice for companies advertising toys to place their adverts within the short videos.

Each time the DC Toys Collector site is watched, the producers are paid.

Industry experts say they get between .60cents and $5 each time the page is viewed.

Google, which owns YouTube, takes 45 per cent of any money earned.

The company Open Slate, which analyses YouTube, estimated that in 2014 DC Toys Collector earned $4.9m.

They reached the figure by looking at the account's subscribers, social media reach and average monthly view count.

In the videos DC Toys Collector's face is never seen. Viewers only ever see her hands and hear her slightly accented voice.

Each video always begins with the words: 'Hey guys, Disney Collector here'.

The narrator, who has a slight accent, regularly uses the words 'adorable' to describe the toys and carefully unwraps each item before explaining its features.

The videos are expertly produced with professional sound and lighting.

A focal point of the videos are the brightly coloured fingernails that often feature toy characters intricately painted on them.

The videos are said to have an entrancing effect on children who sit mesmerized as the toys are slowly opened in front of their eyes.

Technology strategist David Williams told the NBC Today show in July 2014 that the effect on kids, including his own, was like 'crack for toddlers'.

He told the show: 'The effect is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after it's over'.

Williams also told Buzz Feed: 'I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute.'

Others have called the DC Toy Collector 'The Toy Whisperer'.

But the couple have gone to great lengths to guard their privacy. No phone number is listed and their names are not even on the phone entry system at the gated community where they now live in Orlando.

Property records listed with Seminole County list 44-year-old Credido as the buyer of a four-bedroom home set on a cul de sac in Orlando in April 2013.

DeJesus' name does not appear on the records.

Neighbours in the development contacted by phone confirmed that DeJesus lives at the address and is mum to an 18-month-old boy.

According to fan websites DeJesus, or Summers, began her porn career when she was 20 years old in 2006.

She lists her hometown as Lages in Santa Catarina, Brazil, and her date of birth as April 1986.

On a webpage called Babepedia she says: 'I was born in a small town in Brazil called Lages. I love the sun, so when I moved to the US Florida seemed like the right place.

'I miss some of my friends in Brazil, but I just love living here! I enjoy the simple life, but big cities have so much to offer; shopping for one! I am a shopoholic, definitely!

'I speak Portuguese and English. What else can I say about myself? Just that I love to get naked.'

In her career she has appeared on the cover of Penthouse magazine and other adult magazines as well as dozens of graphic videos.

It appears she quit or reduced her involvement in the adult film business in 2009 with one fan asking on a site: 'Anyone know what has happened to Sandy Summers?'

Daily Mail.com tracked down Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido's former wife Maribel Barreto

Ms Barreto confirmed that Mr Credido and Daiane de Jesus are behind the DC Toys Collector videos. She is pictured being shown a document with the reported annual income of DC Toys Collector

But when asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen faced and hurried away

Some of the photographs of Summers on adult sites appear to have been taken at their home in Winter Park.

Many of the backdrops in the pictures are identical to those now being shown on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale.

In one she is draped across a stone fireplace. That same fireplace is pictured on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale.

DeJesus and Credido, who ran a now defunct photographic business called High Tec Photography, lived in Winter Park for almost seven years.

The couple aroused the curiosity of neighbours as they were ultra secretive.

One said: 'Messias said he was a photographer but he never left the house. They always made sure that no one would come into the house.

'They were friendly when you bumped into them in the street, but they would not go out of their way to be talkative.'

Another said: 'Word soon got around that Daiane was involved in some sort of adult work. No one liked to ask any questions but once we knew her working name we looked her up.'

Publically available records with Seminole County show that the couple moved in April 2013 from Winter Park to a gated community in Orlando, paying $690,000 for a four-bedroom home.

Daily Mail.com knows the exact location but has declined to publish it.

It is also possible that Ms Barreto works with the couple on the DC Toys Collector website or even plays the part of the hands herself. However, she claimed to DailyMail.com that the couple are behind the production of the videos.

Credido has also recently paid $300,000 for a plot of land in another gated community where he is expected to build a multi-million dollar home.

Records filed with Seminole County court show that DeJesus and Credido were married on December 26, 2013. DeJesus is listed as a single woman while Credido is divorced.

Her birth date is listed on the official form as April 1982 - four years different that Summer's on adult film websites containing her biography

Daily Mail.com has attempted to speak with the couple but they have declined to return any calls."

Hmmm... none of these are originals. They are all retweets and pictures that have undergone multiple resaves.  (Amazingly, no sign of Facebook as a source.)

Every one of the initial tweets wasn't made popular until over a week later. Even the name """"cub of Baghdadi"""" didn't appear until a few iterations into the retweets/reposts.

The picture of the bloody kid is mentioned on Tumblr as a """"her"""" and not """"him"""", so it may not be the same kid.

No source, no indication that he actually died, nothing to identify when the photos were taken, and no viral coverage until a week after it appeared.?

Wow... The audio-only video was posted to YouTube on Mar 21, 2014. That is shortly after Al Qaeda renounced ties to ISIS (Feb 3, 2014) and long before the US bombings and before the beheading videos.

232,"Apple will offer a low power mode on Apple Watch to help boost it through longer days, according to a new report that also takes a stab at dispelling rumors that the company may have elected to all some long-rumored sensors last minute.

With the exception of Pebble products, most current and upcoming smartwatches - including the Apple Watch - will last no more than a day on a single charge. To help mitigate this issue, Apple has reportedly developed a still unannounced software feature of the Apple Watch called Power Reserve, according to the New York Times. It's said to cut power to all non-essential functions and display only the time, helping to extend the watch's life in cases where a recharge may not be possible. The function is similar in concept to the Battery Saver mode in Android 5.0, which can push smartphone battery life from minutes to hours by reducing processor use.

Apple previously stated that the Watch's battery should last only a normal day, requiring a fresh charge at night. Although standard among smartwatches, the issue has created controversy, since many had been hoping Apple would solve the smartwatch industry's battery woes with its inaugural effort.

The report also notes that despite some recent claims to the contrary, Apple's decision to abandon some advanced health tracking features came over 18 months ago, rather than at the last minute. Early experiments in tracking factors like blood pressure and stress are said to have been ditched after the sensors proved unreliable and otherwise unworkable. Instead, the first-generation device only features motion and heart-rate sensors, once again mirroring some competing smartwatches.

The Times also highlights some of the challenges that faced the Apple Watch's development cycle, noting that Apple not only encountered technical difficulties in achieving its ideal design but was also forced to battle the loss of key engineers, some of whom were poached by Google-owned home automation outfit Nest Labs. Among them was Bryan James, who became an Engineering vice president at Nest early last year.

Chief among some of the later challenges was keeping a tight lid on secrecy surrounding the product while simultaneously deploying evaluation units into the real world, for which Apple engineers created dummy casing, including some resembling Samsung smartwatches.

Apple is due to reveal more details about the Watch at a San Francisco press event on March 9th. AppleInsider will be offering live coverage of the event as it progresses."
234,"Christian Bale will not be playing Steve Jobs in the upcoming movie about the Apple co-founder, Hollywood Reporter reports.

Sources say the actor decided he wasn't right for the role, and withdrew.

This is coming after the movie's scriptwriter Aaron Sorkin confirmed that Bale would be playing the prickly tech icon, saying the actor didn't even need to audition.

No word if this'll affect Seth Rogan's negotiations to play Steve Wozniak, but this throws a huge wrinkle into the Danny Boyle-helmed adaptation of Walter Isaacson's critically acclaimed biography of Jobs. If they get desperate to bring Ashton Kutcher back into the turtleneck, we'll know things have taken a dark turn.

Who would you rather see play Jobs? I liked Bale for the role, but my backup choice is Stanley Tucci, if they can age him down somehow for younger scenes. Or Bradley Cooper, who has the right kind of nervous energy to spit out Sorkin's rapid dialogue. [via Hollywood Reporter]"

¡°The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs,¡± Woody said.

Sources close to the production being filmed in metro Detroit also said it wasn¡¯t true that the Caped Crusader¡¯s ride had been stolen.

Buzz about the supposed theft swirled Friday when at least one comic book website reported on the ¡°scuttlebutt¡± that one of the Batmobile models had disappeared and was presumed stolen.

The rumor was greeted and retweeted with smirking skepticism by some ? and insert-your-own-Detroit-joke comments by others.

243,"An alleged bug in iOS 8 appears to be deleting documents stored in iCloud Drive without the user's permission.

Discovered by MacRumors after complaints surfaced from users of the blog site's forums, the bug is triggered by the option to Reset All Settings.

Found in the Reset screen under the General category in Settings for iOS 8, the Reset All Settings option is supposed to simply reset your iOS settings but leave your data and media untouched. Yet several forum users say that's not the case as certain iCloud documents also vanished after they reset all settings.

Based on user comments, the bug seems to be specific to documents from iWork apps, such as Pages, Keynote, and Numbers, MacRumors said. One user reported that his iWork documents were deleted after resetting all settings, but other data files remained in iCloud.

""""HELP,"""" one user wrote. """"Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud.""""

""""I just had this happen to me,"""" another forum user wrote. """"I had a bit of weird behaviour on my iPad, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to just reset all settings. For the hell of it, I did it on my iPhone as well. ALL DOCUMENTS LOST! How on earth does resetting settings (with a clear notice that data will not be lost) wipe out iCloud drive? It's embarassing.""""

Apple's Time Machine feature is supposed to automatically back up your files so you can restore any that are lost. A couple of users said they checked Time Machine but were unable to retrieve the lost iCloud Drive files. However, a third person reported success with Time Machine, at least running the beta of OS X Yosemite. Several of the affected users say they've contacted Apple support personnel, who are investigating the issue.

MacRumors ran its own test on the bug and reported the following:

In our own testing, using """"Reset All Settings"""" deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com. After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite, all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well. Preview and TextEdit documents, which cannot be accessed on the iPhone, remained untouched on the Mac.
iCloud Drive is Apple's answer to Google Drive, Microsoft's OneDrive, and other cloud-based storage services. Beyond just syncing your files between your iOS devices and iCloud, you can directly store and retrieve documents and other files on iCloud Drive just as you can store and retrieve them locally.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
244,"A Catholic priest from Massachusetts had been dead for 48 minutes before he was miraculously resuscitated. However, it is his description about God that is bound to spark a hot debate about the almighty.

Father John Michael O¡¯Neal was officially declared dead for more than 48 minutes, but medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. According to the 71-year-old man of God, the supreme entity isn¡¯t a man, as is popularly assumed and believed. Father O¡¯Neal claims he met God during the brief time he was officially dead and God is a woman.

The catholic father claims God is a warm and comforting motherly figure. The revelation will undoubtedly have a profound bearing on the teachings of Christianity, which firmly believes and even implies that God is a male figure who has watched over us with love and devotion. Though the love and devotion part is corroborated by Father O¡¯Neal, he differs from the church¡¯s teachings about the gender of God.

Father John Micheal O¡¯neal had the chance to meet with the divine when he was rushed to a hospital late last month owing to a massive heart attack. However, Father O¡¯Neal was declared clinically dead shortly after his arrival. Not one to give up hope so easily, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital kept the blood flowing to his brain with the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2.

While the blood flowed with the help of modern science, doctors worked tirelessly to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm. Consistent with near-death experiences, Father O¡¯Neal entered heaven through a gate made of bright light and encountered God. However, instead of the all-mighty father figure, the priest claims he was warmly greeted by a motherly figure. Father O¡¯Neal describes the divine entity as ¡°mother-like ¡®Being of Light.'¡±

¡°Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting. She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother¡¯s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn¡¯t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!¡±

As expected, the priest¡¯s claims about the gender of God has created quite a stir amidst devote Catholics. The intense discussion between the catholic clergy of the archdiocese about the ¡°experience¡± of the father and the ramifications of his revelations persuaded the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.

Though his superiors have disapproved, Father O¡¯Neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the ¡°Holy Mother.¡±

¡°I wish to continue preaching. I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all Catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman¡¦¡±

Given the potency of Father O¡¯Neal¡¯s alleged experience, it is quite likely he might face some resistance and criticism. However, he is prepared, assures the priest.

Taylor Lianne Chandler was born David Roy Fitch circa 1973.

While she was given a male name she is actually intersex which means she had male genitalia but no testicles.

At the same time she also has a uterus and no ovaries.

From a young age she knew that she was in fact female and started to dress as a girl.

Facebook   Taylor Lianne Chandler

In her teens she used testosterone blockers and estrogen enhancers.

During this period her name was changed ? she initially changed it to Paige Victoria Whitney.

She left home age 15 and by 16 she became legally emancipated from her family.

When Taylor was 18 she got in trouble with the police twice ? for a bad cheque and then a DUI.

The following year she revealed she ¡°thought it would be smart to blackmail someone¡± into giving her money for her surgery.

But as soon as she got the money she was arrested and charged for extortion.

Post by Taylor Lianne Chandler.

Taylor was forced to spend 30 days in jail ? during which time she said she was ¡®too ashamed¡¯ to tell any of her family members.

Despite both her birth certificate and drivers licence proving she was female, she claims she was put in a cell with three men and was raped.

At some point in her twenties she underwent surgery to remove her male genitalia.

Since then she has campaigned for gender rights.

In 2001 Taylor was involved in an 'horrific' car accident which made her change her goals.

Facebook

Following a lengthy recovering period she returned to school to study sign language interpreting - and did a two year ITP.

She went on to get a degree in social and behavioural sciences.

In 2004 her dream of opening an online consignment shop came true when she launched Chandler's Designer Consignment.

By 2013 she had found her calling in life - working in crisis management and has consulted on numerous hight profile cases.

In August 2014 Taylor says she met Michael Phelps via the dating app Tinder and they stared to start.

On September 30 2014 her relationship with Olympian Michael was made public and she rose to prominence.

By that time she had fell in love with the swimmer who checked into rehab in September after being arrested for DUI.

Taylor found it was too difficult to continue interpreting after she was in the public eye.

Since telling him she was born intersex she is worried she will lose him.

On 14 November she announced on Facebook that she was an intersex baby.

For the current Watch, the most expensive variant will boast 18-Karat gold plating. While Apple hasn¡¯t revealed any details about the pricing, reports claim that it could go up to the $20,000 mark.

Considering that luxury watch makers like Rolex and Omega use platinum for their high-end watches, it seems like a logical step up for Apple as well. But the publication mentions that Apple has only been ¡°studying¡± the materials, and this is by no means a confirmation about a platinum Watch variant.

254,"The right-hand man of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was killed by an airstrike in Mosul.
An airstrike in the ISIS stronghold of Mosul killed at least two members of the group, including an aide to ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, according to the Iraqi Defense Ministry.
Reports that Baghdadi himself had been killed by a U.S. airstrike circulated in Turkish and Kurdish media Wednesday and were repeated to The Daily Beast by multiple Iraqi sources. But a Pentagon official denied that the ISIS leader was dead. """"There is no validity to the rumor that we've killed Baghdadi,"""" a senior defense official told The Daily Beast.  

The Iraqi Defense Ministry announcement, first reported by al Arabayia, did not specify whether the airstrike was carried out by American or Iraqi forces, but NBC News reports that a senior security official confirmed it was a U.S. airstrike. The article does not clarify whether the security official is American or Iraqi but quotes them as saying that three ISIS leaders were killed, including Baghdadi¡¯s aide Abu Hajar Al-Sufi, an explosives specialist and commander in the town of Tal Afar.

There have been no public statements yet from U.S. officials on the reported airstrikes.

While the U.S. air war in Iraq has been steadily expanding since it began in early August, Thursday¡¯s reports provide the first public indication that ISIS¡¯s senior leadership is being directly targeted.

The rumors of Baghdadi¡¯s death that spread through northern Iraq yesterday may have been triggered by uncertainty over who died in the airstrikes that reportedly killed his aide. It¡¯s also possible that claim¡¯s of Baghdadi¡¯s death could have come from ISIS itself as part of a deception campaign to cover the leader¡¯s tracks and obscure his true status and whereabouts.

Multiple sources, including Kurdish intelligence officials and former Iraqi army officers, told The Daily Beast Wednesday that Baghdadi had died somewhere in Syria after being wounded in a recent airstrike and fleeing Iraq to seek medical treatment.

This was not the first time that rumors of Baghdadi¡¯s death have surfaced. Without an independent press to verify new information, unverified claims can be spread quickly through Iraq as speculation outpacing facts and gets taken for the truth.

But the new reports that ISIS leaders were killed by airstrikes in Mosul, coming only a day after a flurry of claims about Baghdadi¡¯s death in Syria, suggests the group¡¯s leadership is increasingly vulnerable and that Baghdadi may be on the run and seeking sanctuary in Syria where President Obama has not yet authorized military intervention.

255,"Is there a pet door on the Pearly Gates?

During his weekly address in St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis comforted a young boy who was distraught over the recent death of his dog by telling him, """"One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ,"""" the 77-year leader of the Roman Catholic Church said, according to Time. """"Paradise is open to all of God¡¯s creatures.""""

The statement by the pope was welcomed by animal rights groups and humane societies across the globe, who see it as a repudiation of traditional Catholic teaching dating back hundreds of years that holds that animals can¡¯t go to heaven because they have no souls.

""""My inbox got flooded,"""" Christine Gutleben, senior director of faith outreach at the Humane Society, the largest animal protection group in the United States, told the New York Times. """"Almost immediately, everybody was talking about it.""""

Some Catholic scholars, however, have warned that the Pope¡¯s comment was made casually and should not be taken as official Church doctrine. Others point to earlier comments that seem to suggest that Pope Francis has long held beliefs that animals can go to heaven.

""""He said paradise is open to all creatures,"""" Father James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor at large of  the Catholic magazine America, told the Times. """"That sounds pretty clear to me.""""

The statement has also stirred up debate between vegan groups and their counterparts in the meat industry ? with groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) saying the pope¡¯s statement aligns with the view of heaven as a peaceful place and could convince more Catholics to avoid eating meat.

""""It¡¯s a vegan world, life over death and peace between species,"""" said Sarah Withrow King, director of Christian outreach and engagement at PETA. """"I¡¯m not a Catholic historian, but PETA¡¯s motto is that animals aren¡¯t ours, and Christians agree. Animals aren¡¯t ours, they¡¯re God¡¯s.""""

Pope Francis¡¯ statement worried many in the multi-billion dollar meat industry, for whom the idea of Catholics not buying meat ? especially those holiday hams and turkeys in the lead up to Christmas ? equals a potentially large loss of revenue.

""""As on quite a few other things Pope Francis has said, his recent comments on all animals going to heaven have been misinterpreted,"""" Dave Warner, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, told the Times in an email. """"They certainly do not mean that slaughtering and eating animals is a sin.¡± 

Mr. Warner quoted passages from Genesis that say man is given ¡°dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on earth.""""

Father Martin couldn't see how the pope's comments could be interpreted as a proclamation about vegetarianism, but, he said, """"[The pope] is reminding us that all cre"

The story went that while Page, Jones and Bonham reportedly signed up immediately, Plant ripped up the papers right in front of his colleagues.

263,"A photo purporting to show the slain body of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi appears to be a doctored picture of another slain militant killed in Syria in 2013.
Rumors circulated on social media and Iraqi media over the weekend that Baghdadi was slain in a US airstrike several days ago.
Later Iraqi reports said the IS leader was severely wounded in the chest near the Syrian border and was receiving medical treatment.

The reports could not be independently confirmed.

A picture purporting to show Baghdadi¡¯s bloodied body in fatigues also circulated.

However, the picture appears to actually show Baghdadi¡¯s head pasted onto the body of Sami Hafez Al-Abdullah, an Albanian national killed in Syria in 2013, according to an investigation by Storyful, a social media news agency.
A picture of Abdullah, who reportedly also served as an imam in Germany, and a report on his death appeared on Yemenite news site Hournews.net last year.

Despite the apparently doctored photo, Baghdadi¡¯s fate, amid continuing American air strikes, remains unclear. 

Washington expanded its month-long air campaign to Iraq¡¯s Sunni Arab heartland, hitting Islamic State fighters west of Baghdad as troops and allied tribesmen launched a ground assault on Sunday.

The new strikes deepen Washington¡¯s involvement in the conflict and were a significant escalation for President Barack Obama, who made his political career opposing the war in Iraq and pulled out US troops in 2011.

Previous strikes ? since the US air campaign began on August 8 ? had been mainly in support of Kurdish forces in the north.

US warplanes bombed IS fighters around a strategic dam on the Euphrates River in an area that the jihadists have repeatedly tried to capture from government troops and their Sunni militia allies.

¡°We conducted these strikes to prevent terrorists from further threatening the security of the dam, which remains under control of Iraqi security forces, with support from Sunni tribes,¡± Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said.

¡°The potential loss of control of the dam, or a catastrophic failure of the dam ? and the flooding that might result ? would have threatened US personnel and facilities in and around Baghdad, as well as thousands of Iraqi citizens,¡± he added.

Stills from the purported Haines execution video were released to the Internet Saturday, al-Jazeera reported. In the footage, a masked man claims Haines was killed because the United Kingdom said it would arm Kurdish fighters to combat ISIS in Iraq.

¡°This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the peshmerga against the Islamic State,¡± the masked men reportedly said, addressing U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron. The video also contains a threat to second British hostage.

271,"The Canadian government said on Sunday it was investigating reports that a Canadian-Israeli woman who joined Kurdish militias fighting in northern Syria has been captured by Islamic State (Isis) fighters.

According to a blog linked to Isis, several female fighters who fought alongside the Kurds have been taken prisoner, including Gill Rosenberg, a Canadian-born resident of Tel Aviv. Israel Radio reported Kurdish sources denying the claims, saying Rosenberg was not in the area when it was attacked.

A Canadian government spokesman said in a statement his country was ¡°pursuing all appropriate channels¡± as it sought further information and was in touch with local authorities.

Asked by an Israeli television station about the reports, the Israeli defence minister, Moshe Ya¡¯alon, said: ¡°I cannot confirm that and I hope that it isn¡¯t true.¡± The Shin Bet, Israel¡¯s general security service, told the Jerusalem Post: ¡°There are no further details at this stage¡±.

Rosenberg, 31, joined Kurdish troops fighting Isis earlier this month. A former pilot who served in the Israeli Defence Force (IDF), she reportedly contacted Kurdish fighters over the internet before travelling through Iraq to train at one of their camps on the Syrian border.

In an interview with Israel Radio aired in November, Rosenberg said she was training with Kurdish guerrillas with the intention of fighting in Syria. ¡°They are our brothers. They are good people. They love life, a lot like us, really,¡± she said.

The woman, named locally as 24-year-old Li Zhenghua, was found trying to eat the child while in a hospital ward in Shenzhen, southern China, recovering from the birth.

Luckily a nurse saw the woman with her teeth locked around her son and raised the alarm.

The nurse, named as Liu Tianlun, attempted to prise the woman off the baby but the mother refused to let her child go.

She was eventually sedated and extracted from the baby.

A hospital spokesman said: ¡®It was really shocking, the arm was badly damaged and suffered not only heavy bruising but bleeding as a result of the bite.

¡®Fortunately, doctors managed to insert something to stop her closing her teeth and then levered her jaws apart.

¡®After that they gave her a sedative and took the baby to a secure location.¡¯

The mother is believed to have been living on the street after being thrown out by her mother-in-law despite being pregnant.

She is believed to have been surviving on the streets for a number of weeks before going into labour and being taken to hospital.

Hospital staff are deciding whether to give the newborn back to his mother.

273,"The Lebanese army detained a wife and daughter of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as they crossed from Syria nine days ago, security officials said on Tuesday, in a move seen as likely to put pressure on the Islamist chief.

The woman was identified as Saja al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi, by a Lebanese security official and a senior political source.

The Lebanese newspaper As-Safir reported she had been detained in co-ordination with ¡°foreign intelligence.¡±

A Lebanese security source said the arrest was ¡°a powerful card to apply pressure¡± in negotiations to secure the release of 27 members of the Lebanese security forces captured by Islamic militants in August near the Syrian border ? a view shared by other Lebanese officials who confirmed the arrest.

A senior Lebanese security official said al-Baghdadi¡¯s wife had been traveling with one of their daughters, contradicting earlier reports that it was his son. DNA tests were conducted to verify it was al-Baghdadi¡¯s child, the official said.

They were detained in northern Lebanon. Investigators were questioning her at the Lebanese defense ministry.

There was no immediate reaction from Islamic State websites, although some of the group¡¯s supporters rejected the report.

Fawaz Gerges, a Middle East expert at the London School of Economics said the arrest indicated that the American-led coalition seems to have solid intelligence in Syria and Iraq.¡±

¡°I talked to a few people who told me this was a coordinated arrest between American intelligence services and the Lebanese army,¡± he told Reuters.

¡°If I were Abu Bakr Baghdadi, I would be very anxious that they are getting very close,¡± he said. ¡°This is a development ¡¦ that is very alarming for ISIS, in particular the top leadership.¡±

Dulaimi was one of 150 women released from a Syrian government jail in March as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 nuns taken captive by al-Qaeda-linked militants in Syria, according to media reports at the time.

A source with contacts with Iraqi intelligence said the captured woman was an Iraqi wife of al-Baghdadi¡¯s, but could not confirm the name. There was cooperation between Iraqi and Lebanese authorities leading up to her capture, the source said.

Al-Baghdadi has three wives, two Iraqis and one Syrian, according to tribal sources in Iraq.

Islamic State has declared a caliphate and seized wide areas of Iraq and Syria, Lebanon¡¯s neighbor to the east.

The Lebanese security forces have cracked down on the group¡¯s sympathizers and the intelligence services have been extra vigilant on the borders with Syria. They have arrested over the past few months dozens of Islamic militants suspected of staging attacks to expand Islamic State influence in Lebanon.

A U.S.-led alliance is seeking to roll back Islamic State¡¯s territorial gains in Iraq and Syria. U.S. President Barack Obama has vowed to ¡°degrade and ultimately destroy¡± al-Baghdadi¡¯s group, which is seeking to reshape the Middle East according to its radical vision of Islam.

An Islamic State fighter denied that al-Baghdadi¡¯s wife had been arrested. ¡°I have checked with our leaders and they said it was false news. The Lebanese are lying,¡± he said from inside Syria.

Spillover from the Syrian conflict has repeatedly jolted neighboring Lebanon. Militants affiliated to the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front and Islamic State are demanding the release of Islamists held by the Lebanese authorities in exchange for the captured members of the Lebanese security forces.

The United States is offering $10-million for information leading to the location, arrest, or conviction of al-Baghdadi, an Iraqi, whose real name is Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarai.

Al-Baghdadi called for attacks against the rulers of Saudi Arabia in a speech purported to be in his name last month.

He said his self-declared caliphate was expanding in Saudi Arabia and four other Arab countries and called for ¡°volcanoes of jihad¡± the world over in the speech released on Nov. 13.

A CV of al-Baghdadi published on social media in July by Islamic State sympathizers described him as married but gave no further details.

Born in 1971, al-Baghdadi comes from an Iraqi family of preachers and Arabic teachers, according to a biography distributed on Islamist forums that says he studied at the Islamic University in Baghdad.

According to U.S. media reports, al-Baghdadi was detained for several years at Camp Bucca, a U.S.-run prison in southern Iraq, before becoming head of the Islamic State of Iraq in 2010, a predecessor to Islamic State, which expanded into Syria in 2013.

In June this year, his group named him ¡°caliph for the Muslims everywhere,¡± and called on all Muslims to pledge allegiance. Although he is rarely pictured, a video released in July showed him preaching in a mosque in the Iraqi city of Mosul.

The Lebanese authorities have also detained the wife of Anas Shirkas, senior Nusra Front leader from Syria, security officials said on Tuesday. They did not identify her."

She had earlier claimed, through photos published on the same account, that she had joined Kurdish forces battling ISIS in Iraqi Kurdistan in the country¡¯s north.

Jihadists believed to be loyal to ISIS had claimed on Sunday that Rosenberg, along with a number of female fighters, had been abducted near Kobani and that the Israeli military was deliberately trying to curb the news of her capture. However, a number of media outlets subsequently raised doubts over the claims, citing Kurdish sources, who said that Rosenberg was nowhere near Kobani.

""""This is false propaganda by IS,¡± Kurdish sources told The Times of Israel. """"We can say with a high level of certainty that no Israeli volunteer, or any international volunteer for that matter, arrived to fight in the city of Kobani in Syria.""""

277,"According the latest in a string of scoops from 9to5Mac, battery life has been a pressing concern for Apple throughout the development of the Apple Watch. And for the first time, """"sources familiar with the Watch's development"""" have provided some early figures on what consumers can expect when the device ships sometime this year. In short, Apple Watch will exhibit similar longevity to what we've seen from many Android Wear devices on the market today.

Apple was originally shooting to eke out an entire day of battery life from Apple Watch. Obviously that's not all active use; in fact, the company is said to be shooting for 2.5 to 4 hours of active application use with the screen turned on. That'll vary depending on how heavily you use it, of course. But since the wearable's display will often be turned off throughout the day ? and because the iPhone handles a lot of computing tasks ? Apple is apparently hopeful that the watch can make it from morning until you place it back on the wireless charger at night. 19 hours of combined active and passive use seems to be the bar as of right now.

THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE TO EXTEND A SMARTWATCH'S BATTERY LIFE

This isn't unlike what you'd get from the current field of Android smartwatches; use them constantly and they won't last a day. But that changes with more average use. Notably, the Pebble smartwatch continues to blow away the field in terms of battery life, but it's a very different device when compared against a Moto 360 or the Apple Watch. In standby and low-power modes, 9to5Mac's sources say Apple Watch can last through two or three days. And if for some reason you want to use it strictly as a timepiece and leave the screen on at all times, it'll die out after three or so hours. Using it as a workout companion? Your gym routine shouldn't last more than four hours.

Apple is reportedly testing Apple Watch's battery life aggressively ? and in large numbers. 9to5Mac claims the company has distributed over 3,000 units as the development process continues. And while the iPhone is a critical companion to Apple Watch, the device itself may be more powerful than some expected. 9to5Mac says the CPU inside is more or less equally as powerful as the A5 chip that powered the iPhone 4S and iPad 2, and remains in the current-generation iPod touch. Considering the tiny form factor, we're expecting the same fluidity and responsiveness that have become hallmarks of iOS. But as for the battery, Apple can only do so much. The simple fact is that battery technology doesn't evolve at nearly the same rate as the smartphones in our pockets and wearables on our wrists. The company will undoubtedly keep pushing for improvements as Apple Watch's launch nears; it's expected to ship beginning in March."
280,"ISLAMIC State group jihadists are being trained by Saddam Hussein¡¯s former pilots to fly three fighter jets captured from the Syrian military, a monitoring group says.

The planes, which are believed to be MiG-21 and MiG-23 jets, are capable of flying although it is unclear if they are equipped with missiles, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

The jets were seized from Syrian military airports now under IS control in the northern provinces of Aleppo and Raqa, according to the Britain-based group, which has a wide network of sources inside the war-torn country.

It said that former Iraqi army officers who once served under Saddam were supervising the training at the military airport of Jarrah, east of the city of Aleppo.

Witnesses have reported seeing planes flying at a low altitude to avoid detection by radar after taking off from Jarrah.

It comes as the US and its allies carry out a wave of air strikes on IS positions in Syria and Iraq.

The jihadists also control two other airports in Syria ? Albu Kamal near the Iraqi border and Tabqa in Raqa province.

IS has captured large parts of Syria and Iraq, committing atrocities and declaring an Islamic ¡°caliphate¡±.

After the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, some Sunni former officers from Saddam¡¯s army joined the ranks of the Islamic State of Iraq, a branch of al-Qaeda which later became IS.

Meanwhile, sniper and mortar fire from jihadists are preventing authorities from evacuating civilians caught up in the battle for the Syrian border town of Kobane, a local official says.

At the same time, Kobane district chief Anwar Muslim, said US-led air strikes had destroyed many Islamic State group vehicles and artillery pieces, and that the town¡¯s defenders are reinforcing their positions.

¡°There are civilians trapped in the centre and south of town, whom we cannot evacuate because of snipers and mortar fire,¡± Mr Muslim told AFP on Friday.

¡°Their situation is difficult.¡±

There are no precise figures on how many non-combatants remain in Kobane, also known as Ain al-Arab.

Last week, the United Nations spoke of as many as 700, mostly elderly, civilians being trapped in the centre of the town. Another 10,000-13,000 were said to be gathered near the Turkish border.

For its part, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says there are hundreds of civilians in the centre and west of town and that many of them refuse to leave, preferring to die than go into exile.

The IS jihadists, who have seized swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq and declared a ¡°caliphate,¡± first attacked Kobane on September 16 in a bid to seal their control of a long stretch on the Syrian side of the border.

They succeeded in taking nearly half the town before its defenders, aided by US-led air strikes, began pushing them back.

Describing the situation on Friday, Muslim said ¡°you can see their bodies (IS jihadists) in the streets ... Our forces are reinforcing their defensive positions.¡±

281,"The wife and child of the Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State (Isil), have been arrested in Lebanon, security officials and Lebanese politicians said on Tuesday.

An Iraqi women, identified by local security sources as Saja Hamid al-Dulaimi was detained ten days ago at a checkpoint, along with Baghdadi¡¯s son, north of the Lebanese town of Tripoli, a senior security confirmed to the Telegraph.

¡°She had crossed into Lebanon from Syria. She and her son were travelling on fake passports,¡± the source said.

The boy is said to be no older than 11 years of age.

Citing security officials, the Lebanese As-Safir newspaper said the child¡¯s DNA had been tested and showed the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant jihadist group is his father.

Baghdadi¡¯s DNA is likely to have been taken by US officials in the American run Camp Bucca prison in Iraq, where he was detained in 2004.

The newspaper said the arrests had been made after a tip off from a ¡°foreign¡± intelligence agency, that is believed to belong to a Western government.

The wife and child are said to be currently being held in the Ministry of National Defence headquarters in Yarze, just outside Beirut.

Mrs Dulaimi was one of 138 women released from a Syrian government jail in March as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 Syrian nuns being held by Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Qaeda¡¯s branch in Syria.

Though Iraqi, Mrs Dulaimi had reportedly detained along with three of her children during a military operation near the Syria capital Damascus.

Earlier this year a photograph was circulated online purporting to be of Mrs Dulaimi. It showed a young woman with a pale face, clearly defined cheek bones and large eyes. Her hair is covered in a black hijab.

The release of Mrs Dulaimi was repeatedly demanded by the al-Qaeda kidnappers of the nuns, who were captured from a convent in the Syrian Christian town of Maaloula.

One source close to the negotiations told the Telegraph that they had ¡°insisted¡± that without her release negotiations ¡°would not continue¡±.

Mrs Dulaimi¡¯s second detention is likely to be a significant personal blow to Baghdadi and could be used as a bargaining chip against his group, which has captured many foreign, Iraqi and Syrian prisoners and declared a caliphate in territory it has seized in Syria and Iraq.

Baghdadi has three wives, two Iraqis and one Syrian, according to tribal sources in Iraq.

Earlier this year the Telegraph visited the ramshackle neighbourhood of Tobchi in Baghdad, where Baghdadi, whose real name is Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri, spent his early years.

A resident who had played football alongside Baghdadi, when they were both part of a team formed by the local mosque, said he had married shortly after completing his doctorate at the Islamic University in Baghdad at the start of the millennium.

The resident, who asked not to be named recalled that his wife had given birth to a son within less than a year of the marriage ceremony. His son is now approximately 11 years old, matching the age of the boy reportedly captured in Lebanon.

There were some contradicting and unconfirmed reports that the child captured may have been a girl.

Syria's civil war has killed more than 200,000 people in less than four years, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Thursday."

¡°Bono really should ask Tim Cook about the Apple Watch¡¯s battery life.¡± I tweeted that yesterday during the U2 frontman¡¯s awkward vaudeville routine with Cook onstage Tuesday at Apple¡¯s biggest event in years. We were clearly moments away from its end and we hadn¡¯t been told how long the company¡¯s first wearable will run on a single charge. Expected battery life was a glaring omission in an otherwise impressive parade of features and specs. And after ignoring it completely during the Apple Watch¡¯s onstage debut, the company stalwartly refused comment on it during the device demos that followed.

There¡¯s a good reason for that. Sources tell me that Apple isn¡¯t yet happy with the watch¡¯s battery life, which isn¡¯t going to break any industry standards. ¡°It¡¯s about a day right now,¡± said one, adding that Apple is working on various modifications ahead of the device¡¯s 2015 launch to improve it. Reached for comment, Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris declined to provide an estimate on expected battery life, but said the company expects users will charge their Apple Watches once daily. ¡°There¡¯s a lot of new technology packed into Apple Watch and we think people will love using it throughout the day,¡± Kerris said. ¡°We anticipate that people will charge nightly which is why we designed an innovative charging solution that combines our MagSafe technology and inductive charging.¡±

283,"UPDATE: ESPN has confirmed that no such panel will take place, for the love of all that is holy.

Domestic abuse, a crime that victimizes 1.3 million women a year according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, is not an issue that men at the NFL seem capable of addressing, discussing, or addressing their discussion. According to the NCADV, """"In 70-80% of intimate partner homicides, no matter which partner was killed, the man physically abused the woman before the murder.""""

It's men committing it, men not punishing them for it, men not losing their jobs over mishandling it. The end result has been some of the NFL's worst public relations, ever. But ESPN, a sports network that will stop at nothing to free the NFL of this shame, is about to step in and make it all better with a bold plan: Send in more men.

Eleven men, to be exact, who will fill out a panel prior to the Chiefs playing the Patriots tonight on Monday Night Football. The panel will discuss, among other things, domestic abuse and the NFL.

Remember, 1.3 million women are victimized by domestic abuse every year, but none of them will be on the panel. Ray Lewis will be, though. As will Jon Gruden, Mike Tirico, Chris Berman, Cris Carter, Mike Ditka, Adam Schefter, Tom Jackson, Keyshawn Johnson, Stuart Scott and Steve Young. Esquire has a proper shaming here.

How have some of these guys reacted to Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson's domestic abuce scandals and Roger Goodell's gross mishandling of them?

""""Look, the NFL did not create these problems. The people in the NFL created these problems. The players. It¡¯s not the commissioner. It¡¯s not the owners. These kids are given the opportunity to make a lot of money and to play football. Now, if they want to jeopardize that with stupid behavior and doing dumb things, then it¡¯s their fault. Why should the NFL take a black eye for what individuals do?""""

--Mike Ditka

""""The only thing I'm proud about is the team I played for, they did the right thing. Take them off the field... Because you know what? As a man, that's the only thing we really respect. We don't respect no women. We don't respect no kids. The only thing Roger [Goodell] and them can do, take them off the field because they respect that.""""

--Cris Carter

¡°If that (being physically punished) didn¡¯t happen to me along the way I wouldn¡¯t be here with you today. It taught me a lot of learning lessons.¡±

--Keyshawn Johnson

¡°There is no comparison between me and Ray Rice. It¡¯s night and day.¡±

--Ray Lewis

Carter's praising of the Vikings for heroically deactivating Peterson following his admission that he hit his child with a switch is a bit off, as the team had activated him to play that week. This was followed by intense public outcry and led to the Vikings then rescinding the activation a day and a half later. So yeah, they did the right thing, after enough people complained about them doing the very clearly wrong thing.

This is a lot of men who think a lot of things about these issues but they may not possess the eloquence needed to present their points. Although in somebody like Ditka's case, their points are wildly off base anyway. The best type of point we can hope for tonight is """"willful ignorance."""" Why? Because, as Ben Collins writes in his Esquire piece:

""""... ESPN has a $15.2 billion broadcasting agreement with the NFL. You will not hear these words because it would interfere with the amount of money both ESPN and the NFL can make.""""

Mostly, though, the issue is this: On a panel choosing to discuss domestic abuse on the national stage, before an NFL football game, ESPN has filled out the roster with their extremely male water-carrying talking heads. And again, Ray freaking Lewis, who is no doubt being counted on for NFL Punishment Analysis and to discuss his long, hard journey back from being implicated in a double homicide to the unveiling of his statue in front of M&T Stadium. Their choice to talk about the issue is likely to be nothing more than further damage control, rather than an enlightening and frank discussion.

It will be very difficult to indicate that ESPN cares, and the NFL cares, and that you should care, if ESPN can't even take the issue seriously enough to find at the very least a female majority panel to discuss an issue that touches primarily women.

But it's okay, because Roger Goodell went to a domestic abuse call center, where he was very open about his plans to not forget about this issue as fast as he can.

""""[Call center CEO Katie] Ray-Jones said Goodell did not discuss any specific policies the NFL might put in place for domestic violence.""""

286,"A rumor on Tuesday claims Apple's upcoming Apple Watch will be priced at $500 for the mid-tier steel model and up to $5,000 for top-end gold """"Edition"""" versions, a number much higher than previous estimates.

Citing an unnamed source, French website iGen reports Apple is looking to field the Apple Watch at a proposed retail cost of $500 for versions with stainless steel cases and between $4,000 and $5,000 for Apple Watch Edition models. This leaves the Apple Watch Sport version as Apple's lowest-priced option, which the company said would come in at $350.

While the website has been accurate in predicting recent Apple product launches, the claims are unverifiable and should be taken with a grain of salt.

Previous estimates from jewelers and industry analysts pegged high-end Apple Watch Edition models at $1,200. Edition versions are crafted from 18-karat gold, feature sapphire crystal and come with a variety of luxurious strap options. Apple has not commented on whether the entire chassis is solid gold, or merely gold plated, but the company apparently developed a variant of the metal twice as strong as the standard.

Additionally, the source claims Apple is still shooting for a launch on Valentine's Day.

Prior to the Apple Watch announcement, noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo accurately predicted that the device would come in two sizes and multiple models spread across a wide range of price points. At the time, he speculated the wearable could cost into the """"thousands of dollars.""""

Apple announced its anticipated first foray into the wearables market in September, saying only that pricing would start at $350. Given that the Apple Watch Sport is made from relatively low-cost materials ? aluminum, elastomer band and non-sapphire window ? many believe it to be the entry-level model."
288,"Islamic State (IS) fighters may have captured weapons airdropped by the US near the Syrian town of Kobane, intended for the Kurdish forces defending it against the jihadists' onslaught. 

A video posted on YouTube on Tuesday by a group calling itself """"A3maq News"""" purports to show airdropped supplies in the hands of the extremist group. The footage shows a masked and armed militant examining a package attached to a parachute. Later, he looks into crates containing various munitions, including RPG rounds and grenades. 

The video could not immediately be independently verified, but A3maq News has previously posted IS-linked content and the some of the weapons seen in the video appear to match those possessed by Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which supplied the arms.

The grenades seen at 1:28 in the video are reported to be German-made. Berlin sent 10,000 grenades to Iraqi Kurdistan in August as part of a consignment of military aid provided to the KRG's peshmerga fighters, according to publicly available German government documents. 

Additionally, US Central Command confirmed in a statement on Monday that one airdropped bundle had missed its target,. However, CentCom said it had been destroyed in a follow-up airstrike to stop it falling into enemy hands. 


American C-130 planes delivered weapons, ammunition and medical supplies provided by the KRG to People's Protection Units (YPG) fighters at dawn on Sunday, according to a CentCom statement. The operation was intended to """"enable continued resistance against ISIL's attempts to overtake Kobane,"""" CentCom added, using the former name for the Islamic State.

YPG spokesperson Redur Xelil told Reuters that the weapons would """"help greatly"""" in the fight against IS. """"The military assistance dropped by American planes at dawn on Kobane was good and we thank America for this support,"""" he said.

Kobane is surrounded on three sides by IS and is bordered to the north by Turkey. The Turkish government has thus far refused repeated requests to open a land corridor allowing humanitarian and military supplies into the town, leading to accusations of tacit complicity in the IS assault on the Kurds, whose struggle for greater autonomy has long been a thorn in Ankara's side. However, on Monday it announced that it would allow Iraqi Kurdish fighters to cross the border to the town.

The airdrops were the first of their kind, but the US launched a series of airstrikes on IS targets in August, then extended operations into Syria in September. American planes have now carried out more than 135 airstrikes against IS in Kobane, according to the Centcom statement, which it says are indicated to have """"slowed ISIL [S] advances into the city, killed hundreds of their fighters and destroyed or damaged scores of pieces of ISIL combat equipment and fighting positions.""""

During his weekly address in St. Peter's Square, the Catholic leader tried to console a little boy who was heartbroken over the death of his beloved pup.

Of course, this viewpoint goes against the conservative Catholic ideology that because animals don't have souls (!), they can't go to heaven. Some theologians have cautioned, per the New York Times, that Pope Francis """"had spoken casually, not made a doctrinal statement.""""

292,"News of singer Axl Rose¡¯s death spread quickly earlier this week causing concern among fans across the world. However the December 2014 report has now been confirmed as a complete hoax and just the latest in a string of fake celebrity death reports. Thankfully, Guns N' Roses frontman is alive and well.

UPDATE 03/12/2014 : This story seems to be false. (read more)

Axl Rose death hoax spreads on Facebook

Rumors of the singer¡¯s alleged demise gained traction on Monday after a ¡®R.I.P. Axl Rose¡¯ Facebook page attracted nearly one million of ¡®likes¡¯. Those who read the ¡®About¡¯ page were given a believable account of the American singer¡¯s passing:

¡°At about 11 a.m. ET on Monday (December 01, 2014), our beloved singer Axl Rose passed away. Axl Rose was born on February 6, 1962 in Lafayette. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.¡±
Hundreds of fans immediately started writing their messages of condolence on the Facebook page, expressing their sadness that the talented 52-year-old singer, musician and songwriter was dead. And as usual, Twittersphere was frenzied over the death hoax.

Where as some trusting fans believed the post, others were immediately skeptical of the report, perhaps learning their lesson from the huge amount of fake death reports emerging about celebrities over recent months. Some pointed out that the news had not been carried on any major American network, indicating that it was a fake report, as the death of a singer of Axl Rose's stature would be major news across networks.

A recent poll conducted for the Celebrity Post shows that a large majority (89%) of respondents think those Axl Rose death rumors are not funny anymore.

Axl Rose Death Hoax Dismissed Since Singer Is ¡®Alive And Well¡¯

On Tuesday (December 02) the singer's reps officially confirmed that Axl Rose is not dead. ¡°He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. He's still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet,¡± they said.

Some fans have expressed anger at the fake report saying it was reckless, distressing and hurtful to fans of the much loved singer. Others say this shows his extreme popularity across the globe."
295,"Led Zeppelin fans will be disappointed to learn that there¡¯s no reunion tour and a story that appeared in the Daily Mirror suggesting that Robert Plant ripped up an $800 contract for such a gig is false, according to the Guardian.

The reported tour was supposedly financed by Virgin founder Richard Branson, who wanted to turn one of his Virgin planes into a new iteration of ¡°The Starship,¡± the jet? the band used to tour in the 1970s. The group was to play 35 dates in three locales-- London, Berlin and New Jersey.

Guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones had signed on. And the late drummer John Bonham¡¯s son Jason was to play drums for the band. ¡°It was a no-brainer for them but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it,¡± a source told the Daily Mirror. ¡°When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock. There is no way they can go ahead without him.¡±

Turns out, the entire tale is ¡°rubbish,¡± said Plant¡¯s publicist to the Guardian, backing up what Page had said to the publication in September - a Zeppelin reunion was ¡°[not] very likely.¡±"

Apple's mid-range smartwatch will likely start at $500Apple's mid-range smartwatch will likely start at $500

Assuming the sources are correct, that pegs the anodized aluminum Apple Watch Sport as the lower-priced $349 model.

The anonymous sources, speaking with the French site iGen (English translation), also said Apple will ship its smartwatch in time for Valentine's Day in February. While a February release would be nice because it would get Apple Watch on consumer's wrists earlier, doesn't fit with Apple Senior Vice President of Retail Angela Ahrendts comments saying the smartwatch will ship in Spring 2015.

Apple Watch is a smartwatch device with sensors for tracking fitness activities and heart rate. It links to your iPhone to display alerts and messages, lets you reply to messages, shows turn-by-turn directions, learns your fitness routine and offers suggestions for improvement, and more. Three models in two sizes with multiple band options will be available when Apple Watch ships.

Hopefully Apple will release Apple Watch earlier in the year instead of some time in Spring, because even though products like Microsoft's new Band and Fitbit's just announced Surge aren't direct competitors, they are enticing enough to draw away some sales. Waiting until Spring could cost Apple some momentum, too.

iGen has been accurate in the past with Apple information, so they may be right on the pricing, but we're going with Angela Ahrendts on the release time frame because she's clearly in a good position to know when her own company's products will ship."
298,"Although Canadian police have not released the name of the Ottawa shooter, on Wednesday afternoon U.S. sources leaked that the suspect¡¯s name is Michael Zehaf Bibeau, a 32-year-old Canadian who was a recent convert to Islam.

Mr. Bibeau¡¯s name was first broadcast by CBS, allegedly via U.S. intelligence sources who had been in contact with their Canadian counterparts.

The suspect?who was reportedly born and raised in Quebec?has a lengthy criminal past in Montreal, Aylmer, QC and British Columbia.

A Zehaf-Bibeau resided in Montreal¡¯s Villeray-Saint Michel-Park Extension borough between 2004 and 2006.

His most recent court record indicates Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau fell off the map for three years, as far as the Montreal courthouse was concerned, because he failed to show up in court on a simple marijuana charge that had been filed against him on March 14, 2006.

Parliament shooting

He turned up in court more than three years later, on Dec. 12, 2009, to plead guilty to the charge. As part of his sentence he was granted an absolute discharge. (Under that charge the man was charged and convicted under the name Michael Bibeau-Zehaf.)

His most serious conviction came on Dec. 7, 2004, when Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau pleaded guilty to possession of phencyclidine, also known as PCP, and was sentenced to a 60-day prison term.

On the same day, he also pleaded guilty to marijuana possession and was sentenced to one day in prison. He has also been convicted for failing to comply with conditions of a release.

In court records related to another charge for breach of conditions, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau listed his address as being in Aylmer, QC, a city of 40,000 just 23 minutes west of Downtown Ottawa.

And, just two years ago, Mr. Bibeau was on the West Coast.




According to British Columbia Court records, a ¡°Michael Joseph Paul Zehaf Bibeau¡± committed robbery in Vancouver on December 16, 2011, and also racked up a lesser charge of uttering threats.

As of Tuesday evening, Vancouver Police were working with Ottawa law enforcement to pass on information about the suspect¡¯s time in B.C.

¡°The Vancouver Police Department, along with the BC RCMP, are working together to assist an Ottawa City Police and RCMP National Security investigation,¡± wrote Vancouver Police spokesman Randy Fincham late Wednesday afternoon. ¡°Due to the ongoing investigation, there is little information we can share at this time,¡± he added.

Citing confidential sources, the Globe and Mail reported Tuesday that Mr. Bibeau was a ¡°high-risk traveller¡± whose passport had been seized to prevent him from travelling abroad to join ISIS fighters in Iraq or Syria.

On Tuesday, the RCMP confirmed that Martin Rouleau, the man accused of running over two Canadian Forces soldiers in Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu, had been one of 90 suspects under similar observation.

Nevertheless, as of Tuesday the RCMP had not confirmed that they had been monitoring Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau.

Unlike other Canadian homegrown terrorist suspects, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau had no obvious web presence: No Twitter account, no Facebook page, and no Jihadist scrawls in random blogs or YouTube comment sections.

Witnesses say they saw Bibeau wearing a black coat with blue jeans, according to the CBC. The same report says gun used in the attack was a double-barrel shotgun.

Although, if the example of Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu terrorist suspect Martin Rouleau is any indication, he may have changed his name following his conversion to Islam.

Before he allegedly ran over two Canadian soldiers in the parking lot of a Service Canada location, Mr. Rouleau reportedly changed his name to Ahmad LeConverti (Ahmad The Converted).

Although there are no Zehafs listed in Canadian phone books, the name Bibeau is common throughout Quebec.

On Wednesday, Quebecer Micha?l Bideau noted on his Facebook page that he shared virtually the same name and birth year of the alleged shooter.

Early Tuesday afternoon, @V_IMS, a French-language pro-ISIS social media account posted a grainy photo that was allegedly of the Ottawa shooter.

The image, which was apparently snapped from a TV screen using a cell phone, showed a dark-haired man wearing a scarf and holding a light hunting rifle.

Witness accounts from the scene say that the shooter was armed with a double-barreled shotgun.

According to reports from Ottawa Police, however, the shooter was armed with a 30-30 rifle, a caliber common to lever-action hunting rifles that would be consistent with the firearm held by the man featured in the Tweeted image.

The image remains unconfirmed, however, and Twitter suspended the account shortly before 5 p.m. ET."
299,"Young boy is seen holding guns in images circulated on social media

Isis supporters are circulating images of a child they say has become the youngest foreign fighter to be killed in battle for the jihadist group, according a counter-extremism think tank.

The images, which cannot be independently verified, show a young boy believed to be about 10-years-old holding guns, posing with a balaclava stretched across his face and standing alongside a man thought to be his father who is reportedly a militant.

Those sharing the pictures are paying tribute to the child on Twitter as the youngest martyr from the Arabian Peninsula to have been killed in Syria as Isis tries to establish a caliphate across swathes of the region, according to Charlie Cooper, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation.

Mr Cooper said the images have been circulated on social media with hashtags translated as ¡®martyrdom of the cub of Baghdadi and his father'. It is claimed that reports of his death first emerged on 26 September and that he was killed fighting alongside his father.

The child¡¯s alleged death comes after an Australian man fighting for Isis posted a picture online showing his young son holding the severed head of a Syrian soldier in August, with the caption: """"That¡¯s my boy.""""

In the same month, a report by the United Nations Human Rights Council found Isis affiliated groups have recruited, trained and used children in active combat roles.

It also found Isis has established training camps to recruit children into armed roles, where they would receive weapons training and religious education. In Raqqa, children as young as ten were being recruited and trained by Isis.

The UN said: ¡°In using children below the age of 15, the group has committed a war crime.¡±

News of the boy¡¯s alleged death comes as video footage was released showing Isis firing on targets on the besieged Syria-Turkey border town of Kobani.

The video has been distributed by the pro-Isis media group Al-A¡¯amaq, who publish clips showing the strategic assets seized by the group and where it is advancing.

In it, the fighters can be heard vowing to descend on the town in spite of coalition air strikes, with one warning: ¡°We will enter the city and free it from non-believers.¡±"

Now rumors suggest that the gold and stainless steel editions of the Apple Watch may set consumers back by $5,000 and $500, respectively!

Apple revealed that it would release three collections - Sport Collection, Watch Collection and Edition Collection, which would be composed of aluminum, stainless steel and gold cases, respectively. It was anticipated that the company would have three basic price points, which would vary depending on the band choice and perhaps size.

Now, according to French website iGen.fr, the stainless steel version of the Apple Watch will start at $500, whereas the gold variant of the wearable may start from $4000 to $5000.

""""Apple Watch Stainless Steel (polished or black sidereal) would be proposed at $ 500. The Edition model in yellow or pink gold would be sold between $4,000 and $ 5,000 (translated),"""" reveals iGen.fr.

The French website cites reliable sources as the basis of its information. iGen.fr has a track record of being dependable as the publication reported the dimensions of the then impending iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6 smartphones from Apple correctly.

Previous estimates from industry experts have pegged the top-end gold Apple Watch's pricing between $1000 and $5000. The Edition Collection will be fashioned from 18K gold and have sapphire crystal. This variant of the Apple Watch will also come with several expensive strap options. Apple, however, has not disclosed whether the chassis of this variant of the Apple Watch is solid gold or simply gold plated.


According to iGen.fr's sources, the Apple Watch will release by Feb. 2015 on Valentine's Day. Both resellers and distributors are fervently preparing for the mid-Feb release of the Apple Watch next year per the site.

Apple SVP of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts' leaked video to employees let slip that the company would release the Apple Watch in Spring next year.

With the pricing of the stainless steel and gold variants of the Apple Watch veering towards the expensive, it seems the aluminum version is poised to be the low-end model. It will be interesting to see if consumers are willing to spend a bomb on a smartwatch whose performance is not known."
302,"Every year, Apple does some counterprogramming at CES. This year, whether it meant to or not, it may have some big news: 9to5Mac has some new details that say there's a 12-inch MacBook Air with a completely new design, a higher-resolution display, and few of the trappings we've come to expect from a MacBook Air.

Here's Mark Gurman at 9to5Mac:

Apple is preparing an all-new MacBook Air for 2015 with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots in favor of a markedly thinner and lighter body with a higher-resolution display. Sources within Apple, who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer, have provided in-depth details about the machine, and our exclusive artist renditions of the revamped MacBook Air provide the first close look at Apple¡¯s first major step in mobile Mac computing since the Retina MacBook Pro launch in 2012.
According to Gurman's sources, there are a number of other changes as well. The function keys and arrow keys have been redesigned, and the keyboard sits completely edge to edge on the palmrest. It's smaller and narrower, apparently, and the trackpad doesn't have the same clicking feedback. Of course, let's be clear: these are leaks and sources, who are often working with incomplete and occasionally incorrect information. Things also change, a lot, between leaks and release. But also, Mark Gurman has a long history of being right.

These photos, too, are not real. They are renderings, guesses as to what the Macbook might be. But if these sources are right, confirming rumors we've been hearing for months and years ? of a lighter, thinner, higher-res MacBook Air ? 2015 could be a big year for Apple's laptops."

307,"Apple is reportedly planning to market and sell its Apple Watch much differently than its other products by allowing customers to book appointments to try on different watch models, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal.

New spaces will be added to Apple Stores specifically for this purpose, according to the report, which refers to this as a new """"shopping option.""""

Salespeople are being trained to help customers pick out specific models.

This falls in line with what we've already heard regarding Apple's retail strategy for the Apple Watch. Last week, 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman revealed Apple's retail plans for the watch, which included having salespeople ask customers detailed questions about how they plan to use the watch.

Apple has emphasized the fact that it's selling the Apple Watch as a timepiece more than a gadget, so it's not surprising to hear that it's taking a different approach to retail. When it first presented the watch in September, it stressed that the Apple Watch is meant to tell the time before anything else.

It's the first new product category Apple has unveiled since the introduction of the iPad in 2010, and the company's retail strategy will also be telling of how Angel Ahrendts, Apple's new senior vice president of retail, is handling the job.

We're expecting to learn more details, such as pricing for more expensive Apple Watch models and availability, at Apple's event later today."
308,"Nigeria said on Friday it had agreed a ceasefire with Islamist militants Boko Haram and reached a deal for the release of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the group six months ago.

There was no immediate confirmation from the rebels, who have brought five years of havoc in Africa¡¯s top oil producer and triggered an international outcry by seizing the girls from the northeast town of Chibok in April.

¡°I wish to inform this audience that a ceasefire agreement has been concluded,¡± said the head of Nigeria¡¯s military, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, adding the deal had followed three days of talks with the militant sect.

Government spokesman Mike Omeri said the deal covered the release of the captives and Boko Haram had given assurances ¡°that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well.¡±

Their release would be a huge boost for President Goodluck Jonathan, who faces an election next year and has been pilloried at home and abroad for his slow response to the kidnapping and his inability to quell the violence, the biggest security threat to Africa¡¯s biggest economy.

Apart from one appearance on a Boko Haram video, the girls have not been seen since the brazen nighttime raid on the town near the Cameroon border, although police and a parent said last month that one of the victims had been released.

Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates as ¡°Western education is sinful,¡± has killed thousands of people in its fight to create an Islamic caliphate in the vast scrubland of Nigeria¡¯s impoverished northeast.

A senior Nigerian security source confirmed the existence of talks, but said it remained unclear whether Abuja was negotiating with self-proclaimed movement leader Abubakar Shekau, or another faction within the group.

¡°Commitment among parts of Boko Haram and the military does appear to be genuine. It is worth taking seriously,¡± the security source told Reuters.

Several rounds of negotiations have been attempted in recent years but they have never achieved a peace deal, partly because the group is believed to be deeply divided.

¡°There are some talks but it depends on the buy-in of the whole group. I would be surprised if Shekau had suddenly changed his mind and is ready for a ceasefire,¡± the source added.

The government was negotiating with Danladi Ahmadu, a man calling himself the secretary-general of Boko Haram, a presidency source said. It was not clear if Ahmadu is part of the same faction as Shekau.

Security sources in neighbouring Chad said Chadian mediators had been involved in the discussions, which were part of a larger deal that led to the release a week ago of 27 hostages, including 10 Chinese workers, kidnapped in Cameroon.

Separately, Cameroon¡¯s defence ministry said eight soldiers and 107 Boko Haram militants had been killed in fighting in the far north on Wednesday and Thursday, a region that has suffered regular cross-border raids."
311,"Islamic State insurgents released a video on Tuesday purportedly showing the beheading of U.S. journalist James Foley, who had gone missing in Syria nearly two years ago, and images of another American journalist whose life they said depended on U.S. action in Iraq.

The video, titled ¡°A Message To America,¡± was posted on social-media websites. It was not immediately possible to verify its authenticity.

Mr. Foley, who has reported in the Middle East for five years, was kidnapped on Nov. 22, 2012, by unidentified gunmen. Steven Sotloff, who appeared at the end of the video, went missing in northern Syria while he was reporting in July, 2013.

A Twitter account set up by Mr. Foley¡¯s family to help find him said early on Wednesday: ¡°We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.¡±

The White House said that U.S. intelligence agents were working to verify the authenticity of the video.

Islamic State, an al-Qaeda offshoot, had not previously executed American citizens publicly. The Sunni militant group has declared a caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria in areas it controls.

The video, which was posted after the United States resumed air strikes in Iraq for the first time since the end of the U.S. occupation in 2011, opened with a clip of U.S. President Barack Obama saying he had authorized strikes in Iraq.

¡°Obama authorizes military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope toward a new war front against Muslims,¡± words appear in English and Arabic on the screen.

It showed black-and-white aerial footage of air strikes with text saying ¡°American aggression against the Islamic State¡±

A person identified as James Foley and wearing an orange outfit is seen kneeling in the desert as a man in black dress with a black mask stands beside him, holding a knife.

¡°I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality,¡± the kneeling man says.

The man in the mask speaks in a British accent and says: ¡°This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen, of your country. As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression toward the Islamic State.

¡°Today your military air force is attacking us daily in Iraq. Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims. You are no longer fighting an insurgency. We are an Islamic army, and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide.¡±

Following his statement, he beheads the kneeling man.

At the end of the video, words on the side of the screen say ¡°Steven Joel Sotloff¡± as another prisoner in an orange jumpsuit is shown on screen.

¡°The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,¡± the masked man says.

Mr. Foley, a freelance reporter, had been covering Syria¡¯s civil war for GlobalPost. In 2011, he was held for 45 days by forces loyal to former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.

Mr. Sotloff is also a freelancer journalist with published stories in Time Magazine and Foreign Policy. He has worked in Syria, Libya and Yemen.

Islamic State has executed hundreds of people in Syria and Iraq during its advance. Its members follow a hard-line interpretation of Sunni Islam but target all those who oppose it, including Sunni Muslims.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said Islamic State militants had executed 700 members of a Sunni tribe in eastern Syria in two weeks, the majority of them civilians.

¡°We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL,¡± White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said, referring to the militant group by an earlier name, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

¡°If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist, and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends.¡±

Islamic State also released another video on Tuesday that gave the strongest indication yet it might attempt to strike American targets.

The video with the theme ¡°breaking of the American cross¡± boasts Islamic State will emerge victorious over ¡°crusader¡± America.

It follows a video posted on Monday, warning of attacks on American targets if Washington struck against its fighters in Iraq and Syria.

The latest footage spoke of a holy war between Islamic State and the United States, which occupied Iraq for nearly a decade and faced stiff resistance from al-Qaeda.

Unlike al-Qaeda, Islamic State has so far focused on territorial gains designed to eventually establish a full-blown Islamist empire."

323,"NORTH HOLLYWOOD, California -

Kurt Sutter, creator of the hit FX drama Sons of Anarchy, has announced plans to turn the popular television series into a major motion picture.

Sutter, who was also a writer, producer, and director on the series, said in an interview with Hollywood Today magazine that he has long contemplated taking S.O.A. to the big screen following its run on television. ¡°People absolutely loved the show, as did I, and I have put a lot of thought into the matter, and we are going forward with turning it into a feature film¡± Sutter said.

Sons of Anarchy ran for seven seasons on FX, from 2008-2014, and in the process built a huge following. Sutter said the film will star Charlie Hunnam, who played the lead character Jax Teller, as well as Ryan Hurst who played Opie Winston, and Katey Sagal as Gemma Teller. The film, which is a prequel to the storyline of Sons will also introduce fans to Jax¡¯s father, John, who will be played by Brad Pitt.

¡°I am most excited about bringing Brad (Pitt) on as John Teller, he is absolutely perfect for the role. The movie will take place from the day Jax was born, and leads up to the era just before Sons Of Anarchy began as a series.¡±

Sutter also said that he is really happy to bring Ryan Hurst back as Opie Winston, and hopes fans will forgive him for killing Opie off. ¡°Man I tell ya, when we killed Opie off, it was like the thing turned real. I¡¯ve never gone public with this, but I¡¯ve had people get really crazy when they see me in public,¡± said Sutter. ¡°They shout at me, and they get angry - ¡®You shouldn¡¯t have killed Ope! I hope you rot in Hell!,¡¯ that sort of thing. I had people try to run me off the road when they recognized me, although that just might be because I¡¯m kind of a dangerous driver. Anyway, my hope is that this film will help them cope.¡±

Sutter says pre-production on film will begin in the middle of 2015, and will begin shooting sometime in the fall. ¡°For a movie of this scope, with this much storyline attached, you should expect to see the film by the end of 2016,¡± said Sutter. ¡°In the mean time, buy all the official Sons of Anarchy merchandise you can. Every dollar goes to helping get this movie completed. Brad Pitt isn¡¯t cheap, you know.¡±"
324,"Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is pushing back against a claim made by Rep. Duncan Hunter that at least 10 Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant fighters were apprehended trying to come into the U.S. from Mexico.

¡°We have no credible, specific intelligence to that effect,¡± Johnson said of ISIL insurgents illegally entering the country from along the southern border on CNN Wednesday evening. ¡°And I look at the intelligence reports from overseas from our southern border from our intelligence community virtually every day, numerous times a day, to be on the lookout for something of that nature. So, what I¡¯d say to the American public is we¡¯re vigilant in looking out for individuals of suspicion who may be crossing our border.¡±

The top DHS official didn¡¯t mention Hunter, a California Republican congressman, by name. But on several occasions, Johnson said that public officials have a ¡°responsibility¡± to not ¡°unnecessarily frighten the American public.¡±

¡°Let¡¯s not unduly create fear and anxiety in the American public by passing on speculation and rumor,¡± the secretary told host Wolf Blitzer.

Blitzer asked specifically about comments made Tuesday evening by Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee. ¡°[A]t least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,¡± the congressman said during an interview on Fox News, citing information from source from Customs and Border Protection, which is under DHS authority. Hunter also suggested that it was likely that ¡°dozens¡± of others linked to the terrorist group that has recently beheaded two American journalists and two British aid workers would likely not get caught by border agents and make their way into the U.S.

On Wednesday, DHS flatly said that Hunter¡¯s claim was unfounded. ¡°The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,¡± a DHS spokesperson said.

Judicial Watch reported later Wednesday that four ¡°Islamic terrorists¡± had been seized along the southern border in 36 hours.

Hunter¡¯s deputy chief of staff, Joe Kasper, told POLITICO that the congressman stands by his statement, which came from a conversation with a ¡°high-level¡± source, but didn¡¯t elaborate when asked about the individuals¡¯ specific ties to ISIL.

In September, Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah claimed that four men linked to terrorist organizations tried to cross the border earlier that month."

The hooded man with an English accent is believed to be 23-year-old Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, known to fellow Islamic State militants as Jihadi John.

Key suspect: Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary who raps under the name Lyricist Jinn. Photo: YouTube

The former rapper left his family home in an affluent west London suburb last year to fight in the civil war in Syria.

British SAS forces are hunting Foley's killer, using a range of high-tech equipment to track him down and potentially free other hostages.

Murdered: American journalist James Foley. Photo: AP

The Mail on Sunday is reporting that a """"significant force"""" of SAS personnel has been deployed to northern Iraq over the past two days, joining local units fighting the Islamic State. They have fanned out into four-man teams, accompanying Iraqi and Kurdish troops in an effort to find British jihadists.

The Sunday Times reports that Bary is the key focus of the manhunt. He is one of the British jihadists referred to by former hostages as the Beatles because of their British accents. The two others were called """"George"""" and """"Ringo"""".

The two other Britons suspected of involvement in the crime are Aine Davis, a former drug dealer who converted to Islam, and Razul Islam, who is believed to have joined the terrorist group that murdered Foley.

A still from the video of James Foley's execution. Photo: AP

Bary is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trial on terrorism charges in Manhattan, due to his alleged involvement in the bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.

Before leaving the family home to fight in Syria, Bary was an aspiring rapper known as L Jinny whose music was played on one of Britain's most popular radio stations, BBC Radio 1.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

Recordings of his songs will prove vital to the investigating team, with experts using voice recognition technology to match his voice with that of the man who brutally decapitated Mr Foley.

Bary made a number of music videos for his songs, with titles such as Flying High, Dreamer and Overdose.

It is believed he was indoctrinated by an Islamic preacher named Anjem Choudary who persuaded him to join the fight in Syria."

337,"A propaganda video claiming to show U.S. journalist James Wright Foley kneeling on a mountaintop and making a long anti-U.S. statement, presumably under duress, was posted to YouTube on Tuesday. Foley is standing next to an ISIS militant, who makes some remarks placing the blame for Foley¡¯s death on U.S. President Barack Obama, before appearing to behead Foley with a knife.

The video, posted by Furqan Media, an official ISIS outlet, begins with footage of President Obama¡¯s speech announcing his authorization of air strikes against ISIS in northern Iraq, preceded by these words: ¡°Obama authorizes military operation against the Islamic State, effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims.¡± The video, which gives no hint as to where Foley was being held, then shows footage of the recent air strike in northern Iraq, before cutting to the beginning of Foley¡¯s speech.

In the statement, during which he remained calm, Foley appeared to date his remarks by referring to recent strikes in Iraq. He specifically mentioned his brother John, a member of the U.S. Air Force.

The militant at Foley¡¯s side started his speech by saying: ¡°This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country.¡± His statement referred to the recent air strikes, and continued: ¡°You¡¯re no longer fighting an insurgency. We are an Islamic army, and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide, so effectively, any aggression towards the Islamic State is aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic caliphate as their leadership.¡±

Time magazine journalist Steven Sotloff, who has also been missing in Syria since August 2013, was paraded alive toward the end of the video, with the ISIS militant holding him threatening the U.S. president, saying that Sotloff¡¯s life depended on Obama¡¯s next move in Iraq.

Foley, a freelance journalist working for the Global Post, went missing near Taftanaz in Syria on Nov. 22, 2012, as he was on his way out of the country. His family and fellow journalists have been campaigning for his release ever since. Foley also spent six weeks in captivity in Libya while reporting on the war there in 2011. Numerous theories were posited for his disappearance, with many surmising that he was no longer alive, or that he was in Syrian state custody.

Jihadist forums immediately lit up with gloating posts upon the video¡¯s publication, with exhortations to keep pushing the propaganda via social media. Said one, posting on the Hanein forums: ¡°We must upload the video with a title in both Arabic and English for it to arrive to the American people ¡¦ Keep uploading the video every minute since YouTube declared war on us you brothers.¡± Journalists and others, meanwhile, urged people not to share the video.

The original video was immediately removed from YouTube for breaching its terms and conditions on violent content, but multiple copies are continuing to pop up.

Several others pounced on the fact that Foley was shown in military-style fatigues during a split-screen portion of the video. ¡°Look at minute 2:16, is he a soldier or a journalist!!¡± said one."

However,  Nail al-Jubeir, information director at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, e-mailed me that """"Saudi TV has been showing the total arrival ceremony at the airport and at the Palace and nowhere is anything blurred."""" CNN's Hala Gorani tweeted that her colleague Nic Robertson, in Riyadh, saw non-blurred images on Saudi TV. Other news organizations, such as Al Jazeera, showed the meeting without obscuring Michelle Obama¡¯s face.


 

The alleged blurring wasn't the only controversy.  Some Arab media outlets criticized Michelle Obama for wearing a blue dress, rather than a black one. Videos of the short meeting between Salman and President Obama showed the king leaving in the middle of the protocol, abruptly turning around and walking away, in order to go to prayer.

After the meeting, Barack Obama and Salman held a bilateral meeting that included Secretary of State John Kerry, Senator John McCain, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Ambassador Joseph Westphal and CIA director John Brennan.

According to the White House pool report, ¡°Obama and Salman sat in gold chairs. A small table in front of them held a spray of white flowers.¡±

Obama praised the late king in a statement following his death, saying ¡°King Abdullah's vision was dedicated to the education of his people and to greater engagement with the world.¡± In an interview with CNN before the visit, Obama explained why he was hesitant to press the new king about Saudi Arabia¡¯s human rights record, which includes restricting the rights of women.

""""Sometimes we have to balance our need to speak to them about human rights issues with immediate concerns that we have in terms of countering terrorism or dealing with regional stability,"""" Obama said.

344,"While child entrepreneurs have become increasingly common in the last decade, not many hit the lofty heights that 17-year-old ¡°teen wolf¡± Mohammed Islam reached when his trading earnings reached the ¡°high eight figures.¡±

As the New York Post reports, Islam, a teenager from Queens, still lives at home with his parents, but has been trading on the stock exchange on his lunch breaks at Stuyvesant High School. The Teen Wolf is the son of immigrants from Bengal in South Asia. Mohammed trades with two other friends, and they hope to start a hedge fund when the Teen Wolf turns 18 and graduates from high school.

Islam started with penny stocks at the unbelievable age of 9. When most kids are in the fourth grade, they¡¯re learning to play sports, and figuring out fractions. Mohammed was putting his tutoring earnings to work. As often happens on the stock exchange, Islam lost his initial investment. He describes the event as ¡°paralyzing,¡± and swore off the market thinking he just didn¡¯t have the required nerves of steel.

Bengal region of Asia

Perhaps to better understand the losses that crippled him, Islam turned to studying modern finance, and became enthralled with Paul Tudor Jones. Jones is a billionaire from Connecticut who manages hedge funds and private assets. As is often the case, much of Jones¡¯ success came on the heels of failure. Thousands and thousands of dollars lost, over and over, but Jones kept coming back for more, and ultimately captured overwhelming success. That fortitude, paired with his positive outlook, inspired Mohammed to give the game another try. And like the man who inspired him, Mohammed Islam has become a resounding success in his own right.

The Teen Wolf moniker is a reference to Leonardo DiCaprio¡¯s portrayal of Jordan Belfort ? called the ¡°wolf of Wall Street,¡± another young trader who had an uncanny ability to make money on the stock exchanges. Islam and his trading buddies intend to become billionaires by next year.

¡°What makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don¡¯t keep going there¡¯s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.¡±

But according to Mohammed Islam and his friends, it¡¯s not just about the money.

¡°We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence.¡±

The Post reported that despite his resounding success, Islam is shy and modest, and only gave a rough estimate of his earnings. While he has a very bright future, and grand dreams for his journey into it, for now he has to content himself with expensive meals at Morimoto (an upscale Japanese restaurant), a high end BMW that he has no license to drive, and a swanky Manhattan apartment that he¡¯s not old enough to move into.

The real ¡°Wolf of Wall Street¡± wasn¡¯t exactly role model material, and as the Inquisitr pointed out, even the movie was beleaguered in controversy and monetary fraud. Hopefully the catchy nickname ¡°Teen Wolf¡± can be re-imaged by the smart and tenacious teen from New York City."
345,"UTAH COUNTY ? Over the years, holiday office Christmas parties have gained a reputation for crazy antics. Often, there's a lot of heavy drinking. One overly zealous drinker in Utah County nearly killed himself a couple of weeks ago, winding up in the hospital for three days.

Even though the drinks at the party contained no alcohol, a heavy drink nearly put Ryan Roche out of commission for the holidays.

""""I think it was one of those spur of the moment kind of things,"""" Roche said.

As his holiday office party wound down earlier this month, Roche headed for the door with his wife and kids.

""""They busted out some eggnog.""""

An eggnog-chugging contest was getting started, and one of Roche's colleagues called him out to compete. Roche said he's a competitive guy and couldn't walk away.

""""I've already decided, if I'm going to do it, I'm going to win,"""" he said.

The record at that point was 22 seconds. There was a Ruth's Chris Steak House gift card on the line, so Roche faced off against two other co-workers.

""""I just opened up my throat, didn't even swallow,"""" he said. """"I pretty much poured it down.""""

I was pretty much shaking uncontrollably. I was shaking so badly, I was nauseous, and my breathing became a pant.
?Ryan Roche
As the video shows, he drank a quart of eggnog in just 12 seconds, without taking a breath.

""""I got done, and I was gasping, I couldn't breathe.""""

Roche said he was coughing a lot as he headed home, but thought he would be OK. A couple of hours later, he wasn't so sure.

""""I was pretty much shaking uncontrollably,"""" he said. """"I was shaking so badly, I was nauseous, and my breathing became a pant.""""

He asked a friend in medical school to come over to his house and check on him. The friend took him to the hospital.

Roche had aspirated the eggnog to his lungs and was essentially """"dry drowning,"""" the doctors told him.

""""They pretty much had to wheelchair me in, double IV, oxygen, and hooked me up to what they call the nuclear weapon of antibiotics,"""" he said.

The liquid in his lungs was starting an infection. He spent 24 hours in intensive care with a fever, sweats and chills.

""""It was rough,"""" he said. """"Eggnog: not ideal for the lungs.""""

On day three in the hospital, doctors took him off oxygen, and he went home. After about a week, he was back at full strength.

It was a holiday mishap he'll never forget, and also probably never live down. Roche did win, but at quite a price.

""""Not only do I get a Ruth's Chris gift card, but I got a three night's stay in the hospital."""""
346,"OTTAWA, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Canada is trying to confirm reports that a Canadian citizen has been captured in Syria, a foreign ministry spokesman said on Sunday. """"Canada is pursuing all appropriate channels"""" to seek further information and is in touch with local authorities, the spokesman said in a statement. Israeli media reports, including Haaretz newspaper quoting a website associated with Islamic State, said a Canadian-Israeli woman, Gil Rosenberg, has been captured.

348,"One of the best things about the Internet is the speed at which it allows information to be shared. Unfortunately, this means all information -- even false ones like the news about the six-day darkness that would envelop the world in December.

The report """"NASA Confirms Earth Will Experience 6 Days of Total Darkness in December 2014"""" was published by Huzlers.com. Considering the site labeled itself as offering """"a combination of real shocking news and satirical entertainment to keep its visitors in a state of disbelief,"""" the story should have been taken with a grain of salt at the very least.

According to the story, NASA """"confirmed"""" that the Earth would be experiencing six days of nearly complete darkness from Dec. 16 to 22. The event would supposedly happen because of a solar storm that would spur enough dust and debris in space that 90 percent of sunlight would be blocked out.

NASA head Charles Bolden was said to have made the announcement, asking people to remain calm given a solar storm so bad (the biggest in 250 years!) was going to happen that it would block out the sun for 216 hours.

Reporters also apparently """"interviewed"""" people to hear what they had to say about the event, with Michael Hearns responding with a """"We gonna be purgin my n*gga, six days of darkness means six days of turnin up fam.""""

How people took that response seriously is a mystery.

Six days of darkness, if it were to really happen, sounds like a big deal but the story downplays it in the end, noting that officials said that major problems would not arise anyway. A certain Earl Godoy, a NASA scientist, reiterated there would be no problem because the planet could survive on """"artificial light"""" during the event.

NASA has not made any official statements regarding this six-day period of darkness descending on Earth.

The good news is that this means the world will not be falling into darkness for six days in December. The bad news is that people aren't very good at separating what's real from what's not, liking and sharing the story thousands of times since it first came out on Oct. 25.

Huzlers.com was also responsible for reports in the past where Tupac Shakur claimed he was alive, Ebola victims rose from the dead, and Floyd Mayweather offered a $1 million annual salary to have someone read everything for him."
349,"Jessica Chastain is also being sought for a role in Danny Boyle's Sony drama

Seth Rogen is being eyed to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak opposite Christian Bale in Sony's Steve Jobs movie, while Jessica Chastain is also being sought for a role in the film, multiple individuals familiar with the project have told TheWrap.

Danny Boyle is directing the film ? which is not a traditional biopic ? from a script by Aaron Sorkin, who had access to Jobs¡¯ authorized biography by Walter Isaacson.

Also read: Aaron Sorkin Confirms Christian Bale as Steve Jobs: ¡®He Didn't Have to Audition¡¯

The film is expected to follow Jobs during three stressful, high-profile product launches including the first Macintosh in 1984 and Apple's 2001 debut of the iPod.

While neither Chastain nor Rogen have deals in place, the latter actor is in talks to play Wozniak, who created the Apple I computer and co-created the Apple II computer in the mid-1970s.

Scott Rudin, Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady are producing the film, which Sony has high hopes for, as it could be a major awards contender.

Rogen has proved himself more than capable of handling dramatic roles with his performances in ¡°Take This Waltz¡± and ¡°50/50.¡± Rogen's potential pairing with Bale has been compared to Martin Scorsese's decision to cast Jonah Hill alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in ¡°The Wolf of Wall Street,¡± which of course culminated with the actor's second Oscar nomination.

Rogen next stars opposite James Franco in ¡°The Interview,¡± which Sony will release on Christmas Day.

Rogen is represented by UTA, Principal Entertainment LA and attorney Fred Toczek.

Chastain, who is simply being courted for an unspecified role and does not have a deal in place, previously starred in Sony's ¡°Zero Dark Thirty¡± and is known to have a close relationship with studio chief Amy Pascal.

350,"If the past few weeks of nonstop media onslaught about North Korea and The Interview just haven¡¯t quite appeased your insatiable appetite for Kim Jong-Un antics, fear not?there are other things (literally) cooking up his tunic sleeves.

Everyone¡¯s favorite guilty pleasure, the sometimes-reliable, sometimes-not UK rag The Daily Mail, reports that the dictator is eyeing Scotland as the location for his next business venture?an expansion of the restaurant chain known as Pyongyang, which is owned by the North Korean government and used to generate additional cash flow overseas. There are currently franchises in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Kuala Lampur, Jakarta, and more recently, Amsterdam.

Although the proposed new location may seem a bit random, Scotland has allegedly been singled out for two reasons. The first is that Kim Jong-Un and other elite North Korean officials love drinking Scotch whisky. (His father, the late Kim Jong-Il, was a bigger fan of Hennessy, supposedly spending some ?700,000 a year on the cognac.)

In September of this year when the United Kingdom debated whether or not Scotland should be granted sovereignty, Kim Jong-Un was allegedly a supporter of the country¡¯s independence because?as Choe Kwan-il, managing editor of North Korean paper Choson Sinbo, told UK¡¯s Daily Mirror?¡°North Korea is rich in natural resources and we like the taste of Scotch whisky, so [Scotland and North Korea] can be beneficial to each other.¡±

In terms of the potential new addition to the Pyongyang chain, The Daily Mail claims that the other reason why North Korea might single out Scotland is that they want to make nice with some European countries in hopes of improving diplomacy and their global image. North Korean Leadership Watch editor Michael Madden tells the Mail that Kim Jong-Un has been trying to think of ways to buddy up with Scotland ever since its bid for sovereignty, and has more hope for acceptance there than in those other judgy European countries like England and France. Madden also claims that tourists in North Korea are already encouraged to pay tips in Scotch rather than won (the local currency).

Jenny Town of the US-Korea Institute is also quoted as arguing, ¡°North Korea is going to support any country struggling for independence and legitimacy, as North Korea itself still continues to seek validation and recognition of its own legitimacy as a sovereign nation.¡± In this case, that may mean trying to snuggle up with a Pyongyang franchise that will attempt to win over the Scots via dishes such as barbecued cuttlefish, kimchi, pine-nut gruel, dog meat soup, and a mysterious aphrodisiac made out of bears. (Although these foods are served at other Pyongyang restaurants, there is no specific evidence that they¡¯d make their way onto menus in Scotland).

There has been no official announcement from North Korea confirming that they are opening a restaurant in Scotland?in fact, a Korean embassy official recently denied the story to The Independent. But as it is with many other wealth-generating businesses in North Korea, many critics believe that cash flow from the restaurant chain goes straight to Jong-Un himself and his small group of elites with virtually no trickle-down to the North Korean people.

Kim Jong-Un, 31, gained quite a bit of attention earlier this year for his diagnosis of gout, a disease commonly caused by overindulgence in rich, fatty foods. It was widely reported that he became ill and developed a limp and facial swelling because he had become literally addicted to Emmental, more commonly called ¡°Swiss cheese.¡±

No other details about the new restaurant have yet to be verified, so it¡¯s unclear whether tipping in whisky would be encouraged."
352,"A former American soldier from Wisconsin who has become the face of the YPG Kurdish military force in Syria, told UPI Wednesday in an exclusive interview that civilians have been burned in an Islamic State attack, with injuries consistent with chemical weapons.

Jordan Matson, 28, a former U.S. Army soldier speaking from Derik, Syria, said his information comes from Walat Omar, the head field doctor in the embattled border town of Kobane, which is encircled by IS militants. Matson and others in the area said the injuries were caused by chemical weapons.

""""Since I got the phone calls here in the location... I looked into it myself and after I'd seen pictures from fighters... from Kobane, I contacted the local field doctor on the ground in Kobane and he had sent me many pictures from the hospital,"""" Matson said in his first video interview with U.S. media.

""""We're trying to get a video camera to Kobane because they don't have one right now to record the injured and show the world proof of what's going on over there. ... We're making more attempts to have more solidified proof for the rest of the world.""""

Omar posted photos to Facebook of visible burns that were reportedly sustained in the overnight attack.

Matson, a native of Sturtevant, Wisconsin, arrived in Syria last month via Iraq and quickly became the public face of the YPG.

""""Someone had to do it,"""" he said, laughing.

He is more serious in the widely publicized image of him clad in camouflage, a head scarf and carrying a weapon now appearing across YPG's social media accounts. Although the public role """"was thrown on me,"""" Matson is quick to add he's happy to play it because the media attention has """"brought light to the situation here.""""

Matson says American veterans are """"outraged"""" over the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.

""""We do not want to see our brothers' lives be for nothing,"""" he said. """"So, in the hundreds, veterans are lining up to come over here because if our government won't do anything, we will.""""

Matson acknowledged that the recent U.S. airdrops of Iraqi-provided weapons to YPG fighters in Kobane are helpful in the battle against IS, but that more is needed.

On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was asked to explain U.S. support to non-vetted local fighters in Syria.

Earnest said that while there is """"limited insight into those particular fighters... the fact is, at this point, they are working hard to defeat ISIL forces that right now are concentrated on this specific community.""""

""""So we're going to evaluate each of these circumstances as they come along to look for opportunities to support local fighters against ISIL,"""" Earnest said.

Matson said YPG needs more weapons and night vision goggles. The Islamic State militants, he said, fight primarily under cover of darkness and engage with YPG within 300 meters.

Night vision goggles """"would give us the ability to see them coming, organize our defenses and engage the enemy, and force ISIS to fight us at day because we would have a larger advantage.""""

On Tuesday, the YPG launched a recruitment campaign. """"JOIN People's Defense Units/YPG/in Rojava, Syria, SEND TERRORISTS TO HELL and SAVE HUMANITY,"""" reads the YPG's 'Lions of Rojava' recruitment message.

The page profiles American fighters, including Matson, who have traveled to Syria to join the battle against IS.

Matson encouraged his Facebook followers to consider joining the YPG, directing those interested to visit the newly established YPG recruitment page: """"For all those looking to join the YPG... send them a private message. They will explain what you need for your journey and will organize travel arrangements for you. Thank you all for your patience and god bless.""""

It's unclear how many Americans are now overseas but Matson said Wednesday there are """"hundreds.""""

Neither the U.S. Army nor the Pentagon would comment on the travel of former veterans to Syria.

The YPG has identified two other Americans who have joined its defense forces. Brian Wilson of Ohio, and Jeremy Woodard, a former infantryman from Mississippi.

Wilson declined to be interviewed.

Woodard's brother, Allen, expressed frustration with Jeremy's decision to travel to Syria. In a public Facebook post last month, he wrote:

""""I talk to him almost everyday and still don't really understand why the hell he did go over there but he is there now and nothing I can do about it now. I just hope he makes it back fine. I think the military failed him this time. He never got the war and stuff out of him and the VA's mental health didn't keep a watch on him... His reasoning and excuses for going over there just don't make sense at all."""""

""""They said they wanted it at 2:20 p.m. on the dot,"""" LeFevre said. """"I gave it to our delivery driver and he went down there and took it to the front desk.""""

When he came back, LeFevre said, Rob was visibly happy.

""""He was clearly pretty ecstatic about something so I asked him what's going on,"""" Le said. """"He said, 'I just had a life-changing delivery.' He was kind of blown away.""""

McVey said when the driver realized what was going on, it was a priceless moment.

362,"ELON, N.C. ? A recent rumor claims that Elon University has banned the term ¡°freshman¡± because it¡¯s sexist. But the rumor is not true, according to the university.

A junior student at Elon University recently wrote an article for the College Fix, a website for students, claiming the school dropped the term and replaced it with ¡°first year.¡±

The post claims it was an official move made by the school this fall to promote inclusivity, diversity, and ensure the campus does not promote sexist stereotypes or create a hostile and unsafe environment for female students. The National Review Online also picked up the story.

The article claimed the school implemented the term ¡°first-year¡± in everything from its website to orientation workshops.

But Dan Anderson, vice president of university communications at Elon, told the Burlington Times-News there is no ban or new policy.

Anderson said the university uses the term ¡°first-year¡± because it applies to more students than the term ¡°freshman.¡±

He said the school uses ¡°first-year¡± to describe any student in the first year at Elon, as opposed to a recent high school graduate.

¡°Elon has done what most schools have done and gone to using ¡®first-year¡¯ more frequently because ¡®first-year¡¯ encompasses more than just traditional freshmen,¡± Anderson said. ¡°We still use ¡®freshman¡¯ when it refers to traditional students who come right out of high school.¡±

But a number of folks who know Islam told Business Insider that they strongly believe that the $72 million figure is just a rumor - a rumor that Islam hasn't denied.

In the article, he acknowledged to Pressler over caviar and apple juice that his net worth was in the """"high eight figures.""""

A source familiar with the story told Business Insider that Islam is not worth $72 million. The source believes it's a rumor started by Islam's friends or partners that was perpetuated by the New York Magazine article.

Pressler has also defended the story. She Tweeted that she saw a bank statement with the eight figures and is comfortable with what's in the piece. She also Tweeted that New York Magazine """"is not a financial publication.""""

Business Insider actually featured Islam on our list of """"20 Under 20"""" in finance just over a year ago. He was nominated by his peers.

In a phone interview on Monday Islam's partner Damir Tulemagabetov, who was also in the New York Magazine article, said the $72 million figure isn't necessarily completely accurate.

""""Let me put it this way...it's stated as a rumor,"""" Tulemaganbetov told us when we asked him if he would deny the $72 million figure. He was with Islam in a car headed to CNBC's studios in New Jersey.

""""All the hype, [Islam] deserves it,"""" Tulemaganbetov said. Adding that he is """"pretty sure"""" Islam is a """"a great trader"""" and that he's a """"genius.""""

Business Insider asked for audited numbers or P&L statements to prove that Islam's networth is close to $72 million. Tulemaganbetov refused.

Islam himself did not respond to our email this morning requesting the numbers. He also would not get on the phone when Business Insider learned he was riding in the car to CNBC.

The investment club for young traders, of which Islam is a member, sent Business Insider this statement regarding the $72 million figure:

It has been brought to the attention of the Leaders Investment Club that Mohammed Islam has been rumored to have made $72,000,000 through making trades in the stock market. After performing due diligence and talking with Mohammed Islam himself, we have determined that these claims are false and simply been blown up by the media in the interests of sensationalism.

Islam's partner Tulemaganbetov, however, would not be that clear in his coversation with Business Insider.

""""We can't just talk about the numbers. It's not just about the money,"""" Tulemaganbetov said. """"We're on the verge of a lot of great things in our lives so we can't just focus on providing you the statements. We're on the verge of a lot of great things. We are going to talk to CNBC.""""

Again, Business Insider pressed the issue of the P&L statements.

""""All those statements...that's good for you. We know what we're doing. We're managing this whole hype and everything. We are trying to work with it. We were never expecting it and never denied. You have no proof.""""

Tulemaganbetov told us that Islam didn't expect all the attention. He just expected a magazine article.

A mass grave with an unconfirmed number of bodies was discovered in a part of Mexico near to where 43 college students were abducted, authorities announced Saturday night.

Guerrero State Attorney General I?aky Blanco said there was a connection between the burial site and the students¡¯ disappearance from a teachers¡¯ college the previous weekend, the Wall Street Journal reports. However, Blanco said it would be ¡°irresponsible¡± without DNA tests to confirm that the bodies were the missing students.

Mexico¡¯s Proceso, citing anonymous sources, reported that 20 bodies had been discovered. The Associated Press reports that six pits had been discovered but did not report a body count.

The students disappeared after clashing with police during a protest that turned violent. Officials have detained 30 people, including 22 police officers, in the case. Blanco said that a local criminal organization, Los Guerreros Unidos, was connected with the violence and the disappearances.

Close to 100,000 Mexicans have been killed or gone missing in drug-related violence since 2006, when former President Felipe Calderon ordered the country¡¯s military to reclaim parts of the country under the influence of drug cartels.

Asya Abdullah, co-chair of the Democratic Union Party (PYD), who is in Kobane told Kurdish Question that a gas attack had taken place in an Eastern neighbourhood of the city tonight (21 Oct). Abdullah said that they didn't know where the gas had come from because there hadn' t been any explosions.

She said: """"It could have been a silent missile or a missile placed in the neighbourhood beforehand. Many people have lost consciousness and are struggling to breathe and see. We are investigating the situation but do not have the necessary technical equipment to do tests.""""

Dr. Welat, one of four doctors in Kobane told Guney Yildiz, a journalist at BBC World that he suspected the chemical attack was either chlorine gas or phosphorous shells. Dr Welat said: """"We can't confirm a chemical attack without proper tests and ask that medical equipment be airdropped for this.""""

This is the second incident to have occurred where Islamic State may have used chemical weapons in Kobane."

370,"Ignoring the idiotic instances where people intentionally started bending iPhone 6 units in stores just to prove it can be done, Apple did have an iPhone 6 Bendgate problem, which genuinely affected some early buyers. Early reports have shown that the iPhone 6 Plus was more prone to bending than its smaller sibling, with some users explaining why the iPhone 6 Plus can bend in a certain way ? apparently the area around the bottom volume button lacks the kind of reinforcement that can prevent bending. However, Apple might have fixed the issue, one Reddit user seems to indicate.

Redditor doctorkuddles says that he just purchased an 128GB iPhone 6 Plus that feels different than his wife¡¯s early 16GB iPhone 6 Plus model.

¡°I can¡¯t prove anything. I can only look at my iPhone 6 Plus I got yesterday, and the 6 Plus my wife got on September 20th,¡± he explains. ¡°We have identical phones minus the GB size (I have 128GB, she has the 16GB) Both are space gray. I started looking at both phones closely.

¡°First difference I noticed is the smoothness on the week one phone compared to the week 6 (?) phone. Completely softer and smoother. The second difference I noted was when I started tapping (¡®flicking¡¯) the back and sides of both phones. Right where the previous ¡®bends¡¯ were in previous 6 Pluses (above and below the volume rocker), there is a night and day difference in sound,¡± he adds.

doctorkuddles further says he used a stethoscope to listen to the iPhone 6 Plus and found that his 128GB phone sounds ¡°much more dull toned, indicating to me it¡¯s more solid¡± whereas ¡°her phone had a lot more percussion sound, indicating that area was previously hollow¡±

He then took it under a microscope, without dismantling it. He looked through the cracks of the volume buttons and spotted a ¡°red colored object placed in the volume down button crank.¡±

Furthermore, he weighed and measured both devices and found out that while both devices are identical in size, the 128GB version is 21g heavier than the 16GB model.

¡°I just don¡¯t see the memory being that much heavier,¡± he said.

No actual images or videos of any of these findings have been published, so it¡¯s not clear whether doctorkuddles has actually discovered anything.

Interestingly, he contacted the teardown experts at iFixit on the matter, who purchased a brand new 128GB iPhone 6 Plus and weighed it.

¡°It weighs 173.5 grams, a whopping 0.8 grams more than the Day One unit,¡± iFixit¡¯s mdjorie wrote on the same Reddit thread. ¡°I don¡¯t know what¡¯s up with your new unit, OP, but our new unit definitely doesn¡¯t weigh 21 grams more than the Day One device.¡±

It¡¯s not clear whether Apple made any internal design changes to its iPhones since the Bendgate issue was first reported, or whether it would be able to roll out changes so fast in case it did. But a previous report did reveal that Apple takes product launch-related issues and flaws very seriously and looks to fix problems as fast as possible following their discovery."
371,"Bowe Bergdahl exited Taliban captivity in exchange for the U.S. releasing five jihadists to the government of Qatar, and now a U.S. senator claims those jihadists are ¡°in touch¡± with an al-Qaida affiliate, which would confirm the fears of critics who objected to the deal made by the Obama administration.

CNN reported on January 29 that at least one of the five jihadists ¡°has attempted to return to militant activity.¡±

¡°Several U.S. officials across different agencies and branches of the U.S. government have confirmed key details to CNN. The White House referred CNN to the Pentagon.¡±

? Barbara Starr (@barbarastarrcnn) January 29, 2015

The Associated Press provided a similar report, adding a named official to back up the assertion that the jihadists released for Bergdahl are now looking to return to terrorism.

¡°Sen. Lindsey Graham said Thursday that the Taliban detainees released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl have been in touch with members of the al-Qaida linked Haqqani network, yet all five still are being monitored in Qatar.¡±

Graham¡¯s alleged assertions about the status of the five jihadists apparently is based on his visit to Qatar. The AP said that Graham ¡°had been afraid that one of the detainees had left the country,¡± although the Qatari government later assured him that all five jihadists remained in its borders, per the agreement with the U.S. government.

This latest news involving the terrorists exchanged for Bergdahl comes at a time when the Obama administration is dealing with rumors regarding the ongoing investigation into his conduct leading up to his capture.

The Inquisitr previously reported that some pundits and news outlets are claiming the government has decided to charge Bergdahl with desertion.

However, the U.S. Department of Defense flatly denies such allegations. Meanwhile, this denial has caused more speculation on how the unofficial allegations and official denial of those allegations might be part of an ongoing fight behind the scenes.

In fact, the Daily Signal argued the seemingly inconsistent ¡°statements are not inconsistent.¡±

¡°Shaffer and Miklaszewski report that Bergdahl will be charged?ostensibly soon. Kirby is merely saying Bergdahl has not been charged yet. And by saying Bergdahl has not had charges referred against him, he is betting the press and public don¡¯t understand the unique procedural steps in the court-martial process.¡±

The White House had not issued a statement on the latest reports regarding the alleged attempt of one or more of the jihadists released for Bergdahl to return to terrorism as of the time of the publication of this article.

372,"Multiple Iraqi and Kurdish media sources have claimed that some Islamic State (ISIS) militants in Mosul, Iraq, have contracted the deadly Ebola virus, Mashable reports.

The Iraqi outlets reportedly claimed that Ebola had started to spread in a Mosul hospital. The city, known as ISIS¡¯s most important strategic stronghold in Iraq, has been under the control of the Islamic State since June.

Christy Feig, the World Health Organization (WHO) director of communications, told Mashable, ¡°We have no official notification from the Iraqi government that it is Ebola.¡± She said that WHO had reached out to authorities and asked if they needed help investigating the matter.

Kurdish media network Xendan reported that ISIS jihadists¡¯ symptoms were similar to those shown by someone who has contracted Ebola. However, it is highly uncertain whether Mosul health authorities have the means, tools, or skill-set necessary to test for Ebola, given the current hostile environment in the area.

In late December, the Islamic State reportedly executed doctors who refused to treat their militant jihadis. The Washington Post said of the ongoing situation in Mosul, ¡°Services are collapsing, prices are soaring, and medicines are scarce in towns and cities across the ¡®caliphate¡¯ proclaimed in Iraq and Syria by ISIS.¡±

Iraq¡¯s pro-government Al Sabaah (The Morning) daily newspaper reported that Ebola made its way into Mosul through Africa-based Islamist ¡°terrorists¡± who then linked up with ISIS. Mashable notes, however, that the majority of ISIS recruits in Africa have come from countries that have not reported any Ebola cases, such as Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco, Libya, and others.

Meanwhile, Mosul¡¯s liberation remains a strategic priority for Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition. Mosul has been described as ISIS¡¯s de facto capital in Iraq. While under ISIS control, many of the city¡¯s one million residents have lived under fear of severe punishment or execution should they not comply with the jihadists¡¯ mandates."
373,"As Apple gears up to launch the Apple Watch in April this year, Tim Cook while talking to an employee at the Apple Store spilled some extra information about the wearable before the launch. He also gave a tentative time-frame as to when Apple Pay will be reaching Europe. Also, analysts have predicted what Apple might offer at the time of its smartwatch launch.

While we already know that Apple Watch will be water resistant, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple further confirmed it as shower-proof, while chatting with a Kurfurstendamm Apple Store (Berlin) employee. Reported by iGen (via 9to5Mac), the CEO said that he always wears the watch - """"even in the shower"""". Cook added that he puts his Apple Watch on charge every night, which reconfirms the expected battery life from Apple's previous statements and multiple reports.

Regarding Apple Pay, Cook said that the firm plans to bring the service to Europe not """"before the end of the year."""" The announcement is somewhat a contradiction to announcements by UK banks, which in the recent past stated they were in talks to bring the Apple Pay system by the first half of 2015. According to Cook, the mobile payment system should reach Canada as soon as next month.

Meanwhile, Trip Chowdhry, an analyst from Global Equities Research has predicted that Apple might introduce as many as 100,000 apps for the Apple Watch by time it gets launched. The huge number comes from six """"Apple Watch-Kit hackathons"""" in the past few months, which Chowdhry attended, according to a Barrons blog post.

He further states that the $350 (roughly Rs. 21,700) price tag for the smartwatch seems to be no issue because """"On an average an Apple Watch user will have 100 Apps installed, and one way to think about it is that the consumer is getting 100 devices for $350..i.e. $3.50 (roughly Rs. 217) per device,"""" considering each app and its function as a single device.

As for the sales, Apple is being expected to ship almost 42 million units by December this year. """"Since Apple Watch extends iPhone functionality and provides user convenience with 'Glance' and 'Notifications' to an iPhone User, almost every current iPhone user, which are about 350 million users, will also be an Apple Watch user,"""" he explains.

In the blog she says she found out she was pregnant in 2012 and describes the father as ¡®the donator¡¯.

She also claims to be a feminist, fighting women¡¯s rights """"to the point of eschewing a career"""".

The woman wrote when she found out she was having a boy, she was """"in shock, I started crying, weeping at the thought of what I was about to curse the world with"""".

She continued: """"A few days later, I went in for the procedure, as it was fairly later in my pregnancy, I was aware there were certain risks, but it went off without a hitch...I felt strong. I had done something positive, something that would actually make a difference, something good, even though as I would find out, many others wouldn¡¯t see it that way.""""

The blogger says she went on to give birth to a """"beautiful"""" baby girl.

She says: """"I have endured a lot regarding my first pregnancy, but I don¡¯t care. Sometimes, even allies will turn on you, but I don¡¯t care.

""""I stand by my decision to abort my baby because it was a male.

377,"SEOUL ? Early signs yesterday indicated that Mr Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader who has been absent from public view for more than a month, skipped an important annual ritual, which was likely to fuel further speculation about his whereabouts and even his grip on power.

Yesterday was the 69th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers¡¯ Party of Korea. Since taking over the top leadership position after the death of his father, longtime ruler Kim Jong-il, in late 2011, the younger Kim had marked the beginning of this important national holiday by leading top military and party officials on a midnight visit to the Kumsusan mausoleum in Pyongyang.

By Friday morning, the state-run media had made no mention of such a visit, which would have taken place at midnight on Thursday. The gigantic Kumsusan Palace of the Sun ? where the mummified bodies of Mr Kim¡¯s father and his grandfather, the founding president of North Korea, Kim Il-sung, lie in state ? is among the most sacred places in the country.

During the anniversary last year, Mr Kim and his wife also attended the performance of a national choir and the dedication of new buildings. If he did the same this year, the news would probably have been reported in the North Korean media. No public appearance by the leader has been shown in the media since Sept 3.

Speculation escalated after the state-run Korean Central Television confirmed that Mr Kim was not feeling well and showed him limping during a visit to a factory in August. He was first seen limping on North Korean television in July.

While he was absent from public view, Mr Kim continued his work, sending letters to young party cadets and workers, state media said.

South Korean officials and analysts have said the young and obese North Korean leader may be suffering from health problems, such as gout. One Seoul-based website, run by North Korean defectors, recently reported that many of Mr Kim¡¯s daily duties had been taken over by his younger sister, Ms Kim Yo-jong, while he was being treated for health issues caused by his excessive eating and drinking.

A source with access to Pyongyang¡¯s leadership said on Thursday that Mr Kim is in firm control of his government, but had hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises, reported Reuters. The source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing, said: ¡°He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part, too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon.¡±

¡°He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning, but the injury worsened,¡± the source told Reuters.

But on the Internet, bloggers were spreading rumours, with no evidence, that Mr Kim, believed to be about 30, might have been sidelined by a coup engineered by some of the old disgruntled generals. AGENCIES"

381,"¡°Star Wars: The Force Awakens¡± is one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2015 that is scheduled to be released during winter. The latest reports, however, claim that J.J. Abrams, the director of the seventh episode of the epic space opera, wants an early release date for his movie.

¡°Star Wars: The Force Awakens¡± is currently scheduled to be released on Dec. 18, 2015. Based on YouTuber Votesaxon 07¡¯s video, Movie Pilot reports that J.J. Abrams wants to release ¡°Episode 7¡± in the summer of 2015. The report by the aforementioned entertainment news publication claims that the 48-year-old director made the announcement at the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015.

The publication claims that the reason why J.J. Abrams wants to release ¡°Star Wars: The Force Awakens¡± almost six months before its scheduled date is the alleged plot and images leaks from the sets and script. The moviemaker is now worried that these plot leaks will make the film ¡°predictable and not worth watching¡± for the audience.

According to the website, moving the release date forward would be ¡°an extremely brave move,¡± putting it up against other fan-favourite releases such as ¡°Avengers: Age of Ultron,¡± ¡°Jurassic World¡± and ¡°Ant-Man.¡± However, shifting the release date means a lot of work for the moviemakers and the studio. Meanwhile, Ikwiz reports that Disney is ¡°seriously¡± considering J.J. Abrams' demand of summer release of ¡°Star Wars: The Force Awakens.¡±

Fans must note that these reports lack official comments from the associated parties; thus, the information must be taken with a pinch of salt. However, fans know that Disney is seriously dealing with the issue of image leak. Recently, the studio issued a subpoena over the leak of images from ¡°Star Wars: The Force Awakens.¡±

In additional news, J.J. Abrams finally broke his silence on the controversy over the new lightsaber that debuted in ¡°Star Wars: The Force Awakens¡± trailer. Speaking to Collider at a Hollywood event, the director admitted receiving tons of emails arguing about the new lightsaber and its functionality.

""""It's been the funniest thing to see the arguments that have developed over this thing,¡± J.J Abrams said. """"This was not done without a lot of conversation. It's fun to see people have the conversation that we had, but in reverse,¡± the director explained.

¡°Star Wars: The Force Awakens¡± features John Boyega as Finn, Daisy Ridley as Rey, Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, Harrison For as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as Leia, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, and Domhnall Gleeson, Max von Sydow and Adam Driver, all in unspecified roles.

383,"The sale of a private island in Lake M?laren has received international attention, thanks to the assertion that it is Tiger Woods who sells it. But that's not true - the true owner is a Swedish millionaire.

""""If you have 45 million over and want to buy tiger woods house on an island in Lake M?laren? Then it exactly right now you have the chance. """"

Thus wrote radio station Mix Megapol programs last morning on Facebook on January 8, and linked to an object in the broker real estate agency. Anyone who clicked on the link found the island of Great Rullingen, a luxurious island dream equipped with everything from wine cellars to the ancient castle.

At last morning's mail was shared over 300 times, and it was not just those who let themselves be impressed by the island. Even internationally the news that golf star Tiger Woods is now selling its Swedish island become widespread - it is published by the British The Telegraph and the Daily Mail , US New York Post o ch LA Times , and Yahoo .

The only problem with the story is that G?teborgs-Posten drew attention already January 9, that the island is not at all belong to Tiger Woods. It says Johan Vesterberg on estate agency, who do not know how it is that the data started to circulate.

- We have had this island for sale in a few months, and it started to pop up articles around the world that it was Tiger Woods who owned it. How it has started, we have no idea, says Vesterberg.

In several articles written about the island quoted a Sabine Rollinger, an employee of the broker Vladi Private Islands. To The Telegraph, she says for example that Woods took the island, but that after his divorce with Swedish exhustrun Elin Nordegren """"did not need it anymore.""""

But when Viral Inspector reaches Rollinger she writes in an email, """"to avoid misunderstanding"""" that the island is not owned by Tiger Woods, but by a """"Swedish millionaire"""".

- He has commissioned us to sell it for him. As we understood it was designed originally for Tiger Woods and his wife. When their marriage suddenly ran out, he needed, however, it no longer writes Rollinger in an email.

It rejects, however, Johan Vesterberg on estate agency.

- It is not owned by Tiger Woods, and what we know, he has never owned it. The present owners have built it on the island now, and he did not for Tiger Woods, but for my part, he says.

It's not the first time that Big roll no is up for sale. Already in 2011 attracted the attention of the media when it could be sold for 75 million. However, there was no one who bought the island at the time, and now the price has thus been reduced by 30 million.

If you are conspiratorially inclined, of course, think it is very appropriate to task about Tiger Woods now gives the sales international attention. But that's not the broker real estate agency who planted the story, at least not according to Johan Vesterberg.

- It is definitely not a negative to get noticed in this way. It is not no way we're working on, but we will not say no to the attention even if it is not true, he says."
384,"What's thought to be an audio recording of the shooting death of Michael Brown has reportedly surfaced. According to CNN, an unidentified man, who has since been interviewed by the FBI, is said to have managed to record the incident in which Michael Brown was shot by Officer Darren Wilson earlier this month, setting off a national firestorm. 

The most notable tidbit from the short recording (and what will become subject to the most immediately scrutiny and parsing) is the existence of two distinct volleys of gunfire from Officer Darren Wilson's weapon. From CNN:

In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.

The man who recorded the shooting was talking to someone on video chat when the sounds of gunfire erupted in the background. The Daily Mail added:

Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows, if it is authentic, that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown.""""

Also of some serious importance, should the tape's authenticity be confirmed, is the fact that ten (or, by some counts, eleven) shots were fired at Brown by Wilson.

Historian and archivist Ignazio Perrucci, was hired by the Vatican authorities in 2012, to sort, analyze and classify some 6,000 ancient documents that had been uncovered in the gigantic archive vaults. He was already very excited when he noticed that the author of the text was the famous Roman historian Velleius, but he was completely stunned when he realized the nature of the content.

Professor Perrucci found the text in the archives of the Vatican, while searching amongst a bundle of personal letters and other trivial documents dating from the Roman era.

The text as a whole is a narrative of the author¡¯s return journey from Parthia to Rome that occurred in 31 AD, recorded in a highly rhetorical style of four sheets of parchment. He describes many different episodes taking place during his trip, like a a violent sandstorm in Mesopotamia and visit to a temple in Melitta (modern day Mdina, in Malta).

The part of the text that really caught M. Perrucci¡¯s attention is an episode taking place in the city of Sebaste (near modern day Nablus, in the West Bank). The author first describes the arrival of a great leader in the town with a group of disciples and followers, causing many of the lower class people from neighbouring villages to gather around them. According to Velleius, that great man¡¯s name was I?sous de Nazarenus, a Greco-Latin translation of Jesus¡¯ Hebrew name, Yeshua haNotzri.

Upon entering town, Jesus would have visited the house of a woman named Elisheba, who had just given birth to a stillborn child. Jesus picked up the dead child and uttered a prayer in Aramaic to the heavens, which unfortunately the author describes as ¡°immensus¡±, meaning incomprehensible. To the crowd¡¯s surprise and amazement, the baby came back to life almost immediately, crying and squirming like a healthy newborn.

Marcus Velleius Paterculus, being a Roman officer of Campanian origins, seems to perceive Jesus Christ as a great doctor and miracle man, without associating him in any way to the Jewish concept of Messiah.

Many tests and analysis have been realized over the last weeks to determine the authenticity of the manuscript. The composition of the parchment and ink, the literary style and handwriting have all been carefully scrutinized and were considered to be entirely legitimate. The dating analysis also revealed that the sheepskin parchment on which the text is written, does indeed date from the 1st century of this era, more precisely from between 20-45 AD.

This new text from an author known for his reliability, brings a brand new perspective on the life of the historical character that is Jesus of Nazareth. It comes to confirm the Gospels on the facts that he was known for accomplishing miracles and that his sheer presence in a town was enough to attract crowds of people.

A complete and official translation of the document should be made available online in many different languages over the next few weeks, but the impact of the discovery is already felt in the scientific community. Many scholars have already saluted the finding as one of the greatest breakthrough ever realized in the study of the historical life of Jesus, while others have expressed doubts about the conclusions of Professor Perrucci and demand for more tests to be performed by other scientific institutions before drawing any conclusions."

Both of those rumors spread this month across social media.

The fake turkey recall first appeared on a satirical website called ¡°National Report.¡± The article quoted the CDC as saying millions of turkeys were unsafe because of avian flu.

The USDA¡¯s Food Safety Inspection Service went on Twitter to debunk the hoax, saying the agency would post any real recalls on its website.

A boy who was almost killed when he was knocked out by a huge electrical shock claims he has become a LIVING MAGNET with superpowers like those of Marvel's Magneto.

Nikolai Kryaglyachenko, 12, was blasted across the pavement when he leant briefly against a lamppost that was live from a faulty wire.

""""When I came round I felt groggy but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened,"""" he said.

""""When I woke up the next day and got out of bed I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body.

""""Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest.""""

Europics   'Superpowers': Nikolai Kryaglyachenko wants to be a superhero when he grows up

Nikolai said he was a keen fan of comics and, believing that maybe he had developed some sort of super magnetic power to attract metal like Magneto, had decided to put it to the test.

""""I can do things I couldn't do before but I don't have a lot of control over it,"""" he said.

""""Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things.

""""Once I even attracted a glass - it just moved towards me.""""

Nikolai added that he has now decided instead of a fireman he wants to be a superhero when he is older, saying that he would want to do something that helped people, and the job would certainly fulfil that role.

Europics   Look at me: Nikolai Kryaglyachenko 'performs' for his classmates

He has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his superpowers, and Nikolai even claims that he seems to be able to share his power.

According to his classmates, he can influence others so that other people turn into live magnets as well.

Nikolai's classmate, Vika Balandina, said: """"I could even hang a ladle on my nose.""""

Stories about """"living magnets"""" began to appear at least in the middle of the 19th century.

In 2004, the story of a Russian factory worker Leonid Tenkaev and his family received extensive media coverage when he appeared to obtain the ability to attract objects after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

390,"According to The Washington Post, Emwazi grew up in a well-to-do family in west London. He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the militant group.

He is said to have graduated from college with a degree in computer programming at the University of Westminster.

The militant has appeared in a series of videos in which hostages, including British aid worker Alan Henning, were brutally murdered.

""""I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John,"""" said one of his close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post. """"He was like a brother to me... I am sure it is him.""""

Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said after watching one of the videos: """"There was an extremely strong resemblance. This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person.""""

'Counter-terrorism'
Scotland Yard has refused to confirm the reports.

Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: """"We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

""""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""""

From Britain to Syria via Kuwait, Tanzania and the Netherlands
Emwazi is understood to have arrived in Britain as a young boy, aged six, after being born in Kuwait. Growing up in west London, he was described as a """"polite, mild-mannered"""" man with a penchant for wearing stylish clothes.

It was during a trip to Tanzania in August 2009 that Emwazi's life direction is thought to have started to change. Once landing in Dar es Salaam on the supposed Safari trip with two friends, he alleged he was detained by gun-wielding Tanzanian police and held overnight.

The trio were eventually refused entry to Tanzania and returned to the Netherlands, where they said they were questioned by MI5 agents who accused them of having links to Islamic extremists.

An article in The Independent in May 2010 outlines the allegations. Upon returning to the UK, Emwazi was reportedly on the radar of MI5, who warned him that he was on a terror watch list which prevented him travelling to any Muslim country.

He is later understood to have filed a complaint with the Independent Police Complaints Commission over his treatment.

Emwazi later moved to Kuwait, where he got a job at a computer company. But on a visit to London in June 2010, it is understood he was detained once again by counter-terrorism officials and prevented from flying back.

Two years later he was apparently in Syria fighting alongside IS.

His first public appearance was last August in a video of the murder of American journalist James Foley in August, dressed in black with only his eyes visible. He later reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, American aid worker Peter Kassig and British charity worker Alan Henning.

British and US security services have previously inferred that they knew his identity, but Thursday morning's developments and naming appear to have taken authorities by surprise.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: """"There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by so-called ISIL in Syria. We are not going to give a running commentary on any element of a live operational security investigation."""""
391,"The Department of Homeland Security flatly denied on Wednesday a claim from a California Congressman that the ISIS terror army is quietly slipping into the United States through its porous southern border ? and that American border patrol agents have already captured ten of its soldiers.

Republican Duncan Hunter told a Fox News Channel audience on Tuesday that ISIS, the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, is actively infiltrating the U.S.

'I know that at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,' he said. 'There's nobody talking about it.'

But DHS fired back, saying in a statement that Hunter's claim is 'categorically false.'

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Rep. Duncan Hunter stunned a Fox News audience by saying that the US has apprehended about ten ISIS terrorists as they entered the country through the Mexican border

Vulnerable: Much of the Texas-Mexico border is essentially undefended, with US Border Patrol agents setting up well on the American side

'The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,' a Homeland Security spokesman said in a statement, using the administration's preferred alternative acronym for the group.

'DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.'

CBS News reported Wednesday that one of Hunter's sources 'nuanced their claims' after the Fox broadcast, saying that some of the people he referred to may have been 'ISIS-affiliated or possibly Americans who fought with the Syrian Free Army.'

The FSA is an ISIS foe, not an ally.

Hunter's spokesman pushed back, defending his claim.

¡°The congressman was conveying what he knows ? and what he was told,' the spokesperson said in a statement.

'It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn¡¯t know what the right hand is doing ? it¡¯s been that way for a long time and we don¡¯t expect that to change.'

Hunter, like many in the GOP, has advocated in the past for strengthening America's border security to the south, a demand that has largely fallen on deaf ears during the Obama presidency.

During a 2013 Senate hearing, then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said that due to the administration's 'significant progress and efforts ... our borders have, in fact, never been stronger.'

But Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, claimed Tuesday that the nation's 1,933-mile southern border represents ISIS's best hope of waging war on the U.S.

'If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border,' he said. 'It's that simple.'

'ISIS doesn't have a navy, they don't have an air force, they don't have nuclear weapons. The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming in through the southern border ? which they already have.'

'You're talking about OUR southern border?' Fox host Greta can Susteren was shocked to hear Hunter's claim that ISIS is infiltrating the US

Host Greta Van Susteren was caught flat-footed. 'Are you talking about ours?' she asked. 'You're talking about our southern border? You're not talking about the southern border of Iraq?'

'They aren't flying B-1 bombers, bombing American cities,' he replied, 'but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.'

The three-term congressman cited a similar fear that Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey expressed during an August 21 Pentagon press briefing.

Dempsey called ISIS 'an immediate threat ... because of open borders and immigration issues.'

Hunter said his information came directly from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which has a 20,000-strong army of agents patrolling the borders in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California.

'I've asked the border patrol,' he said, adding that he was told about the ten ISIS fighters who were caught crossing the border.

'If they catch five or ten of them, then you know there's gonna be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol,' he said. 'But that's how you know: All you have to do is ask the border patrol.'

The government watchdog group Judicial Watch claimed in August that ISIS terrorists were 'planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle born [sic] improvised explosive devices.'

The group said a 'warning bulletin for an imminent terrorist attack' had been issued to 'agents across a number of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense agencies,'instructing them 'to aggressively work all possible leads and sources' to prevent the attacks.

The Department of Homeland Security flatly denied that in a statement to MailOnline.

'We are aware of absolutely nothing credible to substantiate this claim,' a bewildered DHS spokesman said

'In Mexico? I haven't seen that at all.'

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on the same day Judicial Watch made its claims that his agency and the FBI were 'unaware of any specific, credible threat to the U.S. homeland' from the terror network."

People found with small amounts of marijuana would be issued court summonses and be allowed to continue on their way without being handcuffed and taken to station houses for fingerprinting.

The change would remake the way the police in New York City handle the most common drug offenses and would represent Mayor Bill de Blasio¡¯s most significant effort since taking office to address the enduring effects of the department¡¯s excessive stop-and-frisk practices.

398,"(CNN) -- Could a newly released audio provide more clues on what led up to Michael Brown's shooting death?

The FBI has questioned a man who says he recorded audio of gunfire at the time Brown was shot by Ferguson, Missouri, police on August 9, the man's attorney told CNN.

In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.

""""I was very concerned about that pause ... because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired,"""" the man's attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN's Don Lemon. """"And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.""""

The man, who asked that his identity not be revealed, lives near the site of the shooting and was close enough to have heard the gunshots, his attorney said.

He was speaking to a friend on a video chat service and happened to be recording the conversation at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.

The attorney said she learned of the man's recording late last week from a mutual friend.

""""I had to get his consent before I could reach out to the FBI,"""" Blumenthal said.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the tape and has asked the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the man who made the recording.

The meaning of the pause

It's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports.

Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots.

""""It's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless -- he has no weapon,"""" said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell.

Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer.

But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.

""""To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,"""" said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN's """"Crossfire."""" """"Maybe the officer will say, 'Well, I fired and he kept advancing, so I fired again.' """"

Witnesses and a friend of Officer Darren Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led up to Brown's death.

Dueling narratives in Michael Brown shooting

Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown's who was walking with him at the time of the shooting, said the officer shot Brown once by the police car and again as he ran away.

According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting.

But a friend of Wilson said Brown mocked the officer and charged at him before the shooting began.

An autopsy showed that all the entry wounds were in the front of Brown's body.

Will autopsy shed any light on what happened?

Key witness speaks out

Ferguson police said Brown allegedly robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting.

And reports that his friend Johnson had a criminal record that includes lying to police has put Johnson's credibility in question.

In 2011, Johnson was arrested and accused of theft and lying to police about his first name, age and address.

Johnson said Monday night he doesn't understand why some are questioning his credibility.

""""I see they bring up my past, my history, but it's not like it's a long rap sheet,"""" Johnson told Lemon. """"This one incident shouldn't make me a bad person.""""

Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid was asked whether it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for children after a snowstorm in the country's north. His response:
It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.

? SHEIKH MOHAMMED SALEH AL-MUNAJJID
Quoting Muslim scholars, he argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, which is considered sinful under the country's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.

The ruling does open up the possibility of the building of a snowapple.
God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on.

401,"Google Inc. plans to buy about half of Redwood City's mammoth Pacific Shores Center office campus in a stunning deal that could reshuffle the Peninsula real estate scene.

Even by the standards of Google¡¯s relentless real-estate acquisition spree, this is a big one. The world's biggest search-engine company is buying six office buildings totaling nearly a million square feet, according to several industry sources who were not willing to talk about the deal publicly. The project is owned by the Blackstone Group and Starwood Capital and managed by Equity Office.

The purchase ? which could close later this month ? would be Mountain View-based Google¡¯s most dramatic real estate move this year. It opens up another front in the search giant¡¯s rapid Peninsula expansion after big deals in Palo Alto and Sunnyvale. And it provides a potential seaborne solution to increasingly gridlocked highways: Pacific Shores is spitting distance from the Port of Redwood City, where Google has been experimenting with commuter ferries as a way to reduce the demands on its extensive bus network.

Google declined to comment. Blackstone didn¡¯t respond to a request for comment. I¡¯m told the sale is close to being finalized, though it¡¯s still possible the deal could still fall through. Google's deposit isn't yet non-refundable, a customary marker for a deal headed toward the finish line, a person familiar with the transaction said.

¡°If any deal is done by anyone, we¡¯d welcome them to Redwood City,¡± Mayor Jeffrey Gee told me in a phone call on Friday, adding that he¡¯d wait to comment on Google¡¯s potential arrival until a deal is complete.

Brokers said the impact of the acquisition, if completed, would ripple through the commercial real estate market. Assuming Google intends to occupy the space, tenants currently in the buildings ? which are more than 90 percent leased ? would have to find new space as their leases end. And Google tends to grow wherever it puts down roots.

¡°It adds fuel to the fire for more spec buildings to start coming out of the ground, because there¡¯s going to be that much more pressure on space demand,¡± said Tim Grant, a veteran Bay Area office broker with Avison Young in Foster City.

The deal would mark another sign of tech companies taking a shine to the north Peninsula, coming just weeks after Box Inc. agreed to lease a major office project in downtown Redwood City.

¡°This is one more thing,¡± Grant said. ¡°We¡¯ve always been thought of as, ¡®Maybe, but I¡¯d rather be in San Francisco or (southern) Silicon Valley.¡¯ Suddenly, the middle maybe isn¡¯t a bad place to be.¡±

Google is expected to buy Blackstone and Starwood¡¯s buildings at 1200, 1300, 1600, 1700, 1800 and 1900 Seaport Blvd., which total 934,000 square feet and are home to tenants such as Zazzle Inc. and Rocket Fuel. Google is not buying 2000 and 2100 Seaport Blvd., the owner-occupied headquarters of Informatica Corp. Nor is Google buying 1400 and 1500 Seaport Blvd., which includes DreamWorks. Those buildings are owned by Shorenstein, which has been in contract for a while to sell them to San Francisco-based investor DivcoWest, according to sources and public records.

The price Google will pay was not immediately clear, but an observer estimated it at ¡°substantially more¡± than the $525 per square foot that Informatica paid for the two buildings it bought in 2012.

One of the Valley¡¯s marquee campuses, Pacific Shores was built by Jay Paul Co. in the early 2000s and broke new ground for its sleek design and swanky amenities including pools, a rock-climbing wall, day spa and baseball diamonds. It was one of the first major developments that showed multiple tech companies would share the same campus, and rose taller than the one- and two-story buildings that were the standard for tech. Starwood bought the campus in 2006 for about $833 million, and immediately sold Shorenstein its two buildings. Blackstone came into the picture after acquiring the junior debt on the property a couple of years ago.

A new owner could build even more office space there, city officials said. The entire campus contains about 1.7 million square feet of office space, and new zoning approved about a year ago could allow total build-out of up to 3 million square feet.

¡°All things considered, there's still quite a bit of room to put more structures out there,¡± said Sailesh Mehra, associate city planner for the city. ¡°You could essentially double that entire office park, if you can you could park it.¡±

Google ? which like many expanding tech companies is focused on reducing its car and shuttle trips as traffic worsens during the current boom ? may be eyeing transit options beyond freeways. Pacific Shores is a half mile from the Port of Redwood City, where a Google pilot project earlier this year tested running ferries from San Francisco and Alameda to the port. The Water Emergency Transportation Authority, which administers the San Francisco Bay Ferry routes, has studied regular public ferry service to Redwood City, with a potential public terminal practically next door to Pacific Shores.

""""I know they really liked the ferry and the concept. Their challenge was getting people off a boat and putting them on a bus to Mountain View, and that was taking 25 minutes,"""" said Kevin Connolly, director of planning and development for WETA. """"This might be one way to address it.""""

San Mateo County has about $22 million left in a sales-tax funded pot for ferry services in the county. A Redwood City terminal would cost about $15 million. But the county doesn't have ongoing operational funding, Connolly said.

A major built-in user such as Google could help make service pencil out, he said.

""""If they're serious about doing it, we could do something, and there are lots of options,"""" Connolly said. """"We could be very creative about working this out.""""

If the deal is completed, it would probably take several years for Google to truly put its stamp on Redwood City. Tenants are in the buildings long term, and Google¡¯s continued expansion elsewhere in Silicon Valley ? it just leased another 424,000 square feet in Sunnyvale? means it¡¯s probably not under immediate pressure to occupy the campus.

The current and future Google growth """"(is) going to impact the face of the Valley,"""" Mark Bodie, a senior vice president with JLL who represents landlords, said on a market update call with media earlier this week,. """"It's really going to change the dynamics of what's available for lease.""""

Sgt Gill Cherry said: """"We are treating these two reported incidents as linked, and are appealing to the local community to help trace the man responsible.

""""It is very unusual behaviour, and will have left his victims feeling confused and upset.""""

Shoppers in Carlisle said they were bemused, but frightened by the man's behaviour.

405,"Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary was known as 'L Jinny' as a rapper

Saturday 23 August 2014

A former rapper fighting with the Islamic State (Isis) in Syria is believed to be one of several British jihadists under investigation following the beheading of James Foley.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 24, was known as L Jinny or Lyricist Jinn at home in London, where his rising music career saw him appear in videos and have his singles played on BBC Radio in 2012.

He came to national attention earlier this year, when he posted a picture of himself holding a severed head on Twitter after resurfacing in Syria.

The gruesome picture, believed to have been taken in the Isis stronghold of Raqqa, was captioned: ¡°Chillin¡¯ with my homie or what¡¯s left of him.¡±

Bary reportedly travelled to the country last year from Maida Vale, west London, where he lived with his mother and five siblings.

His father Adel Abdul Bary, an Egyptian refugee thought to be one of Osama Bin Laden¡¯s closes lieutenants, was extradited from Britain to the United States on charges of terrorism in 2012 for his alleged roles in the bombings of two US embassies in east Africa in 1998.

His family is frequently mentioned in rap songs that are still floating around the internet, with many people, unaware of L Jinny¡¯s macabre transformation, praising his lyrics.

In early songs put online in 2012, Bary makes apparent reference to drug use, violence and life on a council estate and talks about the threat of his family being deported to Egypt.

¡°It¡¯s hard to progress in the future with a damaged past but still I try to count my blessings and I thank Allah,¡± he rapped in 2012.

¡°I¡¯m trying to change my ways but there¡¯s blood on my hands and I can¡¯t change my ways until there's funds in the bank.

¡°I can¡¯t differentiate the angels from the demons, my heart¡¯s disintegrating. I ain't got normal feelings.

¡°Even my life¡¯s blessed, still I will not find rest.¡±

In later songs, apparent references to cannabis (¡°roll up and watch the leaves ignite¡±) stop and are replaced with tirades against people who choose to spend their money clubbing, drinking and on drugs rather than feeding their families.

Many British jihadists are known to be in Syria, including these men featuring in an Isis video to urge Islamists in the West to join them  The most recent video, which was posted on YouTube in March this year, is called ¡°The Beginning¡±.

¡°Give me the pride and the honour like my father, I swear the day they came and took my dad, I could have killed a cop or two,¡± Bary raps.

¡°Imagine then I was only six, picture what I¡¯d do now with a loaded stick. Like boom bang fine, I¡¯m wishing you were dead, violate my brothers and I¡¯m filling you with lead.¡±

Bary¡¯s current whereabouts in Syria is not known and his Twitter account under the name ¡°Terrorist¡± @ItsLJinny has been deactivated.

Previous posts mentioned Abu Hussein al Britani, a fellow Isis militant who has uploaded pictures of himself on Twitter with guns in Syria.

He and associate Abu Abdullah al-Britani were seen offering travel advice to would-be jihadists online earlier this year.

The Sun newspaper has linked the trio to a group of British jihadists known as ¡°The Beatles¡±, including the man known as ¡°John¡± who beheaded American journalist Mr Foley.

In pictures: James Foley

A sound expert who compared the footage of the brutal killing with Bary¡¯s rap songs told the paper there was a ¡°big likeness¡± between the voices.

Mr Foley¡¯s murderer has not been identified by authorities but the Foreign Secretary said he sounded British and experts were urgently trying to trace him.

Police are believed to be preparing for raids on several homes across Britain in efforts to trace ¡°jihadi John¡± but a spokesperson for the Counter Terrorism Unit at Scotland Yard would not confirm the identities of any suspects."
406,"According to the latest research from our WDE (Wearables) research service, the Apple Watch smartwatch will ship 15 million units worldwide in 2015. Apple will quickly become the world¡¯s number one smartwatch vendor with 55 percent global marketshare this year.

We forecast total global smartwatch shipments to grow 511 percent from 4.6 million units in 2014 to 28.1 million units in 2015. Most of the smartwatch growth will come from the new Apple Watch, which we forecast to ship 15.4 million units worldwide in 2015. Apple will quickly become the world¡¯s number one smartwatch vendor and capture 55 percent global marketshare this year.

The Apple Watch is the catalyst to ignite the global smartwatch market. Apple¡¯s famous brand, loyal fan base, deep retail presence and extensive apps ecosystem will ensure healthy uptake for its Watch. However, Apple¡¯s first-generation Watch is not yet perfect. For example, Apple¡¯s Watch hardware design is arguably less attractive than some rival models such as the Huawei Watch, battery life may not be as long as many traditional wristwatch owners are used to, and Apple¡¯s premium pricing may be challenging for mass-market consumers. Apple will need to upgrade tangibly its second-generation Watch to stay ahead of competitors later this year."
407,"The health-focused smartwatch that Apple initially envisioned is not the same one the company will unveil next month, according to a new report.

Apple's original concept for the Apple Watch was one that would track blood pressure, heart activity, stress levels and other functions, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing sources familiar with the device. But none of those features will make it into the final product due to a variety of issues, according to the Journal. Some features didn't work properly. Others proved too complex. And some would have required regulatory approval. As such, Apple was forced to scale back the range and depth of health features for its first entry into the smartwatch arena, the sources said.

Due out in April, the Apple Watch will enter an already crowded playing field, competing with products from Samsung, Sony, Motorola, Microsoft, LG and others. It's been thought that Apple postponed its release of a smartwatch at least in part to perfect the health and fitness monitoring features. But if the Journal's sources are correct, some of those features proved more challenging than expected.

For example, the Journal reported, Apple tested sensors to measure skin conductivity, which would have helped monitor stress levels and heart rate. But the sensors ran into inconsistencies with different people, such as those with hairy arms or dry skin, and the results were mixed based on how tightly you wore the watch, according to the Journal's sources.

Apple also tested ways to check blood pressure and the level of oxygen in the blood, but again, the results were inconsistent. Further, if those features strayed into the area of actually providing medical advice, they would have required approval from the Food and Drug Administration -- something Apple was trying to avoid.

The difficulties in creating a smartwatch with such features prompted people at Apple to dub the project a """"black hole"""" as it sucked in more and more resources, one of the sources said.

As a result, Apple has been touting its first smartwatch as more of an all-purpose wearable. Yes, several key health and fitness features will be available and useful, especially as third-party developers create apps to tap into that market. But Apple is also busy promoting other aspects of the watch, including its variety of styles, its ability to act as an adjunct to the iPhone, its support for Apple Pay and its voice-activated controls.

Will those features and the Apple name convince enough consumers to consider the Apple Watch over the competition? In December, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster projected unit sales of 8 million for 2015. Wall Street has been forecasting sales of 12 million to 15 million. Apple has reportedly asked its suppliers to manufacture 5 million to 6 million watches for its first quarter of release.

Whether initial sales are as healthy as expected, Apple will certainly come out with future models. Those could even include some of the health features that didn't pass muster the first time around, the Journal's sources added.

An Apple spokeswoman told CNET that the company declined to comment on rumor or speculation."

Apparently, Rodney Constantine himself commented on the post and is planning to turn himself in.

Constantine let police know he¡¯ll be coming in ¡°Monday morn,¡± but the RNC police politely reminded him that their facilities are open 24/7.

What proceeded was a weird and hilarious correspondence between police and Constantine in the comment section.

The RNC police told BuzzFeed News that they believe this is their guy, but he has yet to physically turn himself in.

¡°It¡¯s hard to say if the person we found is the person, but it certainly seems that way,¡± Media Relations Officer Steve Curnew told BuzzFeed News.

Curnew also explained that they only turn to their social media outlets as a ¡°last resort¡± if they can¡¯t locate them by addresses on file. While police are hopeful they have the right Rodney Constantine, ¡°no one by that name has turned themselves in yet.¡±

414,"While Apple has yet to publicly announce a specific launch date for the Apple Watch beyond """"Early 2015"""", sources speaking to 9to5Mac say the company is currently planning for a March debut in the initial wave of countries. Sources in the retail segment indicate that select store employees will undergo centralized Apple Watch training the week of February 9, with those employees in turn training others at their individual stores in the days leading up to the device's launch.

One or two representatives from many Apple Stores in the United States, depending on store and market size, will be sent to Apple offices in either Cupertino, California or Austin, Texas to learn first-hand about the Watch. These training programs will take place between February 9th and February 16th.The report indicates Apple has been continuing to refine various aspects of the Apple Watch since its September unveiling, focusing mostly on software but also tweaking such components as the inductive charging mechanism.

Developers are currently working with Apple's WatchKit tools and iOS 8.2 betas to build apps for Apple Watch, starting with lightweight Glances, actionable notifications, and iPhone-based apps that project portions of their interfaces to the watch. More powerful apps running directly on the Apple Watch will be possible later this year.

416,"WASHINGTON (CBS DC) ? Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., says that at least ten fighters for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria have been apprehended while attempting to enter the southern U.S. border.
The California Republican claims that ¡°at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,¡± in a conversation with Fox News on Tuesday. Hunter says that the Islamic terrorists are slipping into the U.S. through the porous southern border as several have already been captured.
¡°There¡¯s nobody talking about it,¡± Rep. Hunter told Fox. ¡°If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border. It¡¯s that simple¡¦They caught them at the border, therefore we know that ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or ten of them then you know there¡¯s going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol.¡±
In August, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, warned that the open border posed an ¡°immediate threat¡± for terrorist activity infiltrating the country. The government watchdog group, Judicial Watch, said ISIS terrorists were ¡°planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle born [sic] improvised explosive devices.¡±
Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said that the 1,933-mile southern border with Mexico is the obvious entry point for Islamic State terrorists. He says that information regarding the capture of Islamic State terrorists crossing the border comes directly from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
¡°ISIS doesn¡¯t have a navy, they don¡¯t have an air force, they don¡¯t have nuclear weapons. The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming through the southern border ? which they already have,¡± he added.
¡°They aren¡¯t flying B-1 bombers, bombing American cities,¡± said Hunter. ¡°But they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico¡¦All you have to do is ask the border patrol.¡±
The Department of Homeland Security released a statement on Wednesday that claims alleging Islamic State militants have been apprehended at the Mexican border are ¡°categorically false.¡±
¡°The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,¡± a DHS spokesman said in a statement today. ¡°DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.¡±
After Hunter¡¯s comments to Fox, one of his sources nuanced their claims, saying that some of those apprehended at the border might be ISIS-affiliated or possibly Americans who fought with the Syrian Free Army ? one of many ISIS enemies.
In a statement to ABC News, a spokesperson for Hunter said he was not backing down on the claims.
¡°The Congressman was conveying what he knows ? and what he was told,¡± the spokesperson told ABC. ¡°It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn¡¯t know what the right hand is doing ? it¡¯s been that way for a long time and we don¡¯t expect that to change.¡±

Quoting from Muslim scholars, Sheikh Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, an action considered sinful under the kingdom's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.

¡°God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,¡± he wrote in his ruling.

That provoked swift responses from Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names.

¡°They are afraid for their faith of everything ... sick minds,¡± one Twitter user wrote.

Another posted a photo of a man in formal Arab garb holding the arm of a ¡°snow bride¡± wearing a bra and lipstick. ¡°The reason for the ban is fear of sedition,¡± he wrote.

418,"VENICE BEACH, Calif. --You've probably heard Apple is launching its latest i-device, a new Apple Watch, in April and that it will start at $350.

But did you know there are three editions of the watch? What no one knows, outside of Apple, is how much the top of the line """"Watch Edition"""" will sell for.

We've seen online reports that it could sell for as much as $4,000. Maybe more.

So we got to wondering: How much would consumers pay for the top-of-the-line Apple Watch?

Not much, as we recently found out in chats with consumers here.

""""I'd get the $350 model,"""" says Ashlea Fellows of Australia. """"I wouldn't go any higher.""""

Thousands of dollars for a gold watch? Not for Karla Gallegos of Chile. """"Too expensive. I could find a watch made of gold for $2,000,"""" she said.

Juan Frias of New York would drop $1,000. """"I like gold watches,"""" he says. """"I'm a teacher, and I wouldn't have to look down at my wrist. My daughter texts me, I can look and nobody can say, `Hey, you're on the phone.'""""

Apple touts the high-end Apple Watch as sporting a 18-karat gold case, which it says is twice as hard as standard gold. And it's protected by sapphire crystal, advertised as almost impossible to break, unlike the gorilla glass of the iPhone.

In mid-2014, many analysts expected Apple to use sapphire glass on the iPhone 6, but that didn't happen. Apple wasn't happy with the sapphire being produced by its factory near Phoenix, which has since been shut down. The company hasn't said where its new sapphire is being produced.

Estimates online for how much Apple will charge for the top-line watch are all over the map. Website Grail-watch.com goes as high as $10,000. """"t's pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size,"""" notes the site.

But even at $4,000 or $5,000, the price tag will make it easily the most expensive item at the Apple Store. It's most expensive computer, the MacPro, starts at around $3,000.

Apple's high-priced watch will be in good company -- and even if it tops the most optimistic estimates, it will be still be way cheaper than the gold standard of luxury watches, the Rolex. Amazon's Rolex page starts at $4,000 and goes all the way up to $62,000.

But those watches don't read back texts or control your music.

With such expensive i-jewelry on display at shopping malls across the world, will it change the way people shop at the Apple Store? Will folks be wary of walking out of the store with a multi-thousand-dollar gold watch on their wrists?

Paul Wallace of Long Beach, Calif., admits that sporting a gold Apple watch on his wrist would make him a target. """"It would¡¦.but you've got to go Gold,"""" he said. """"If you've got it, flaunt it.""""

From CNN:

In one attack, militants ambushed travelers in the Borno state village of Shaffa, residents of the area said, killing eight people and abducting others.

Boko Haram gunmen also stormed the village of Waga in Adamawa state, abducting a number of residents, including women, residents there told CNN.

424,"Apple has remained mum as to its pricing strategy for the three versions of the Apple Watch to be made available next year, only saying that the price will start at $350 for the entry-level version, likely to be the Apple Watch Sport, which features light aluminum and a sweat-resistant band made from a rubbery material.

But jewelry industry experts believe the Apple Watch Edition, which comes with 18-karat yellow gold or rose gold, a sapphire crystal display and Venetian leather for its bands, will cost around $1,200, with other jewelers estimating that Apple's fanciest smartwatch could be priced as much as $10,000.

Watch expert Chad Rickicki of Pittsburgh, Penn. told TechCrunch that an 18-karat gold case that is the size and shape of the Apple Watch could rack up as much as $600 for the raw material. That does not even include the smartwatch's electronic components and the profit margin Apple plans to tack on to the device. All in all, consumers can expect to pay $1,200 for a gold smartwatch, says Rickicki.

However, other jewelers are not as optimistic, saying that we need to understand the materials Apple used for its smartwatch to be able to peg it at a more accurate price. Ariel Adams, founder and editor of watch blog aBlogtoWatch, says Apple adopted watch industry terminology for the Apple Watch. The term """"18-karat gold,"""" he says, likely means the watch is made of solid gold, not gold-plated. Otherwise, Apple would have used the term """"gold-plated.""""

The current market price for gold is $1,200 per ounce. If, for example, the Apple Watch weighs two ounces, that is already $2,400 just for the gold. That is not even considering the special process Apple's own metallurgists invented to create gold that is """"twice as hard as standard gold."""" Adams says Apple has cheaper manufacturing centers in China than the facilities used by Swiss-based watchmakers, but gold is gold and it is expensive wherever it is crafted.

Adams also points out that there is also the cost of sapphire glass to contend with, estimating that Apple has to pay around $30 to $40 for the sapphire crystal case of the Edition smart watch. Sapphire manufacturing, Adams says, is a long and expensive process where the crystals are synthetically grown in large chambers and then cut into rectangles that are then laminated. Adams thinks the high-end Apple Watch will not cost anything less than $5,000 and could go up as much as $10,000.

""""The Edition is going to be far, far less mass-produced than the steel version,"""" he says. """"I think it's going to have a much different type of distribution. It'll be a much more exclusive product."""""

It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn¡¯t know what the right hand is doing ? it¡¯s been that way for a long time and we don¡¯t expect that to change.¡±

428,"Sony's high-profile biopic of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs will have plenty of award winning pedigree behind it, as Oscar winning actor Christian Bale will reportedly play the lead on the project, which also features an Academy Award winning director and screenwriter.

Bale is apparently in final talks to take on the role of Jobs, according to film industry publication Variety, which believes the casting is essentially a done deal. Bale will be directed by Danny Boyle, who won an Oscar for Best Director in 2008 for the film """"Slumdog Millionaire.""""

The two are working from a script by Aaron Sorkin, who himself won an Oscar in 2011 for penning """"The Social Network."""" The film is expected to be loosely based on Walter Isaacson's official Jobs biography.

There has been some turmoil behind the scenes on the project, as director David Fincher was previously attached, but reportedly walked away after making demands of $10 million in up front payment and full control over marketing. Sony, which is responsible for the film, was apparently reluctant to make that commitment after a marketing debacle with Fincher's adaptation of """"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.""""

Bale won an Oscar in 2011 for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in """"The Fighter."""" He was also nominated last year for Best Actor for """"American Hustle,"""" but is perhaps best known for playing Batman in Christopher Nolan's """"Dark Knight"""" trilogy."
431,"Tiger Woods isn't golfing. He's taking some time off to rest, to heal, and to work on his game. But according to one dude who probably doesn't know anything, it's all a coverup, and Woods is actually serving a secret Tour suspension for a failed drug test. Today, both the PGA Tour and Woods's agent flatly deny the claim.

The drug-test rumor came from occasional pro golfer Dan Olsen, and was made on a Lansing, Mich., sports talk radio show on Friday morning. Who the hell is Dan Olsen? Good question! He played a single full season on Tour in 2004, hasn't played a PGA event since 2011, and now mostly caddies and gives lessons. But he had this to say:

""""I've heard that he's suspended. I heard he's on a month's suspension. And it's not, it's kind of a strong witness. It's a credible person that's telling me this. It's not testosterone, but it's something else. I think when it's all said and done, he's gonna surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy.""""
That's a strong allegation to make, and Olsen had better be able to back it up. (He's not, but more on that in a bit.) Today, the PGA Tour said it's all horseshit.

""""There is no truth whatsoever to these claims. We categorically deny these allegations,"""" said Ty Votaw, executive vice president of the PGA Tour.
Woods's agent, too:

""""These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,"""" agent Mark Steinberg said. """"They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous.""""
Olsen is walking back everything he said, telling ESPN.com his Friday comments were """"only my opinion and not based on any first-hand knowledge or facts."""" Which is a claim that relies on a pretty loose definition of the word """"opinion.""""

Olsen went on to say that """"I'll be looked at as just some crazy fucking nobody making accusations about Tiger,"""" and it might have been the first true thing he's said in four days."

A nun living in an Italian convent has given birth to a surprise baby after complaining of stomach pains, according to the Italian press.

The nun, who came to Italy from South America, belonged to an order called the Missionary Sisters of the Love of Christ in Macerata, located in the Italian region of Le Marche.

She says she had no idea she was pregnant.

She was taken to hospital by her sisters, where doctors quickly told her she was pregnant, according to Italian newspaper Il Corriere Adriatico.

Police are hunting a middle-aged man who is slapping high street shoppers if they sneeze.

In what Cumbria Police admit is 'very unusual behaviour', the man, who wears a tweed jacket, first smacked a woman round the head after she sneezed in Carlisle town centre on Monday.

The following day, the same man is thought to have slapped an 82-year-old woman who had just sneezed in Scotch Street, Carlisle. Sgt Gill Cherry of Cumbria Police said the pensioner was left feeling 'confused and upset'.

Police were informed about the first attack by witnesses ? but have yet to trace the victim.

Cumbrian Police described their strange suspect as being in his mid-to-late 50s and wearing a plush, tweed jacket.

The force have now asked for anyone with any information about, or who witnessed, the two related incidents to contact them.

Sgt Gill Cherry from said: 'We are treating these two reported incidents as linked, and are appealing to the local community to help trace the man responsible.

'It is very unusual behaviour, and will have left his victims feeling confused and upset.'

Shoppers in Carlisle yesterday said they were concerned by the eccentric's behaviour, although Nicola Dawson, 48, a dental receptionist, said: 'I have come here shopping on my day off and actually have a cold.

'If anyone smacked me for sneezing I would smack them back.

'If anyone saw someone do something like that I would be surprised if they did not do something as you wouldn't stand for it if you witnessed it.'

Trainee shop assistant Gemma Prosser, 19, added: 'We heard as it happened in the town centre and at first we just thought it was a bit weird.

The shocking incident happened at a hospital in the city of Shenzhen in southern China¡¯s Guangdong Province, where the woman had been discovered heavily pregnant and in labour on the street.

She had been taken into the hospital and had given birth, and then placed in a ward where attempts had been made to contact her family as she was left to nurse the child.

However on the woman's third day in hospital, nurse Liu Tianlun had gone into the bedroom to find the young mother biting her son on the arm. When the nurse raised the alarm and tried to pull the baby free, the mother had refused to let go and continued to bite the tiny limb.

A hospital spokesman said: """"It was really shocking, the arm was badly damaged and suffered not only heavy bruising but bleeding as a result of the bite. Fortunately, doctors managed to insert something to stop her closing her teeth and then levered her jaws apart. After that they gave her a sedative and took the baby to a secure location.""""

Police said the woman had been identified as 24-year-old Li Zhenghua. They said enquiries had found that, despite being pregnant, her mother-in-law had thrown her out on the street after Li started behaving oddly. The family did not alert anybody that Li was pregnant and might be in need of help.

She had apparently survived on the streets for at the very least several weeks and possibly longer before she was spotted in labour and the alarm was raised.

An investigation is now going on to decide what prompted the woman's actions and whether the child should be officially confiscated from both her and her husband's family, who no longer seem to want anything to do with her, and also possibly her child."

A graphic video obtained by NBC News purportedly shows James Wright Foley, a freelance reporter for the U.S.-based news service GlobalPost who was kidnapped while reporting from Syria two years ago, reciting threats against America before he is executed by an ISIS militant.

Foley was kidnapped at gunpoint near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Thanksgiving Day in 2012. He had not been heard from during his time in captivity. """"We¡¯ve heard nothing. Nothing. We last knew that he was abducted on Thanksgiving Day in the Idlib province, but we don¡¯t know who took him or why,"""" Foley's father, John, said on TODAY last year.

In May 2011, Foley recorded a video interview with The Boston Globe about his arrest and captivity in Libya. ¡°You don¡¯t want to be defined as that guy who got captured in 2011,¡± he said. ¡°I believe that front-line journalism is important.¡±

The woman, who is known only as Lana, describes herself as a feminist who has fought for women¡¯s rights ¡°to the point of eschewing a career¡±.

She wrote that when she found out she was pregnant in 2012 she was overjoyed until she realised it was a boy.

¡°I was in shock, I started crying, weeping at the thought of what I was about to curse the world with.

¡°Crying, sobbing, uncontrollable weeping, mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war, I was a refugee, and my home was my refugee camp, an unfamiliar place that was just¡¦ sheltering me.¡±

After three days of mourning about the idea of bringing a ¡°monster¡± into the world, she decided to go to an abortion clinic and have the foetus removed.

She said: ¡°I don¡¯t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn¡¯t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.

¡°If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.¡±

She wrote that during her experiences of fighting for women¡¯s rights, she found that ¡°men generally would look down on us, refuse to help us, or hardly even lend an ear so that we could air our grievances¡±.

¡°This didn¡¯t surprise me, the patriarchy has been well entrenched since the dawn of time, but here I was, here I am, ready to change it,¡± she wrote.

Lana¡¯s blog post has since received much criticism, with people calling her a ¡°mentally ill female¡±, and writing messages such as: ¡°Her mother already brought a monster into the word by giving birth to HER!¡±

On her blog Lana wrote that she had lost many friends and family members over the last three years, and responded to the criticism she had received.

¡°I cannot believe some of the emails that have been forwarded to me, do people really exist who want to see me dead because of what I chose to do with my own body?,¡± she wrote.

¡°The thing that I hope everyone takes away from all of this is that I own the reasons why I chose to have an abortion. Most of you reading probably have no idea what it is like to go through the process of debating whether or not to abort a pregnancy, let alone the actual experience of it.

¡°To me, the experience was liberating, the emotions I felt when deciding what I should do, and after learning my foetus was male was something I wouldn¡¯t wish on my worst enemy. Coming out of it a liberated woman though was more than worth it.¡±

Abortion based on gender is already illegal here in the UK, but MPs have been fighting to clarify the amendment to the 1967 Abortion Act that states this.

450,"TEXAS CITY ? A local plumber is being flooded with phone calls ? and some threats ? after a picture of one of his old company vehicles being used by Islamist militants in Syria was posted on Twitter.
The picture was posted online by the Islamic extremist brigade Ansar al-Deen Front, according to a CBS News report. It shows a black pick-up truck with a Mark-1 Plumbing decal on the door and an anti-aircraft gun in the bed.
Mark Oberholtzer, who has owned and operated Mark-1 Plumbing in Texas City for the past 32 years, confirmed it was his pickup truck in the picture. He said he no longer owned the vehicle and had no idea how it ended up in Syria.
Oberholtzer said he traded in the truck to an AutoNation dealership three years ago. He usually takes the decals off his vehicles when he sells them but he left it on this truck with the expectation that AutoNation would remove it.
¡°They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn¡¯t do it,¡± Oberholtzer said. ¡°How it ended up in Syria, I¡¯ll never know.¡±
He began receiving calls about the truck and the picture on Monday afternoon, Oberholtzer said. By Tuesday he said his business had received a thousand calls and faxes about the image.
¡°A few of the people are really ugly,¡± he said.
Derek Duckett, emergency management coordinator for Texas City, said he was unaware of any threats but was checking with local police to reach out to Mark 1 to see whether it needed assistance.
Oberholtzer said he didn¡¯t know what to do about all the attention he was getting from the picture. He just wanted the public to know that the vehicle was no longer his.

451,"Comcast, the cable company widely applauded for its outstanding customer service, has unfairly come under fire for its totally reasonable reaction to a customer's complaint.

According to the Consumerist, a customer identified as """"Conal"""" claims he was fired from the accounting firm where he worked after a Comcast rep called his boss and told on him for trying to report his terrible customer service experience to Comcast higher-ups.

The story starts as most Comcast stories start: with the cable company charging Conal for services and equipment he neither requested nor used. When Conal tried to cancel his subscription in October 2013, Comcast reportedly sent him $1,820 worth of equipment he didn't request ? stuff like modems, DVRs, etc. ? and charged him for it. When Conal created an itemized spreadsheet and took it to the Comcast customer-service reps to show them the overcharges, they refused to acknowledge the mistake.

So Conal decided to escalate the issue to the company's controller, but when he spoke to someone in the office there, she was equally unhelpful. No one ever sorted out Conal's customer-service request.

This, Conal claims, is where it gets messy. The accounting firm where he worked reportedly fired him after someone from Comcast contacted his employer to say Conal had called to express his displeasure with Comcast. The call kicked off an ethics investigation that led to Conal's firing.

According to the Consumerist:

Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controller¡¯s office looked him up online and figured out where he worked.

When he was fired, Conal¡¯s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.

Plus, though his company consulted with Comcast, Conal argues that bringing their name up wouldn't have helped his situation in the first place.

Comcast: still the worst."

455,"Questions surrounded purported deal between Nigerian government and Boko Haram for release of missing schoolgirls

The Nigerian government says it has agreed a ceasefire with the Islamist militant group Boko Haram and is negotiating for the release of 219 schoolgirls kidnapped six months ago.

The deal would mark a huge breakthrough after a five-year insurgency by extremists seeking to create an Islamic state in the north of Africa¡¯s most populous country. It has left thousands dead and a worldwide outcry was prompted when the girls were abducted in April from the north-eastern town of Chibok.

Members of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign tweeted: ¡°We are monitoring the news with huge expectations.¡±

But questions surrounded the purported agreement on Friday. Similar claims from the government and military have failed to bear fruit. The Nigerian president, Goodluck Jonathan, is expected to declare that he is standing for re-election, and positive news about the hostages and insurgency could deflect criticism of his handling of the crisis.

Mike Omeri, a government spokesman, told a press conference in the capital, Abuja: ¡°Already, the terrorists have announced a ceasefire in furtherance of their desire for peace. In this regard, the government of Nigeria has, in similar vein, declared a ceasefire.¡±

Omeri claimed that there had been direct negotiations this week about the release of the missing girls. Boko Haram negotiators ¡°assured that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well¡±, he said.

The truce was announced on Friday by Nigeria¡¯s chief of defence staff, Air Marshal Alex Badeh, who ordered his troops to comply immediately with the agreement. Boko Haram has not made a public statement.

The group had been demanding the release of detained extremists in exchange for the girls. Jonathan had said he could not countenance a prisoner swap.

The failure of Jonathan¡¯s government to rescue the girls has prompted an international campaign and daily Bring Back Our Girls rallies in Abuja to highlight the girls¡¯ plight. There was further anger when posters calling for Jonathan¡¯s re-election in February by using the hashtag BringBackGoodluck2015 appeared until he ordered them to be torn down.

In July, Jonathan met for the first time parents of the girls and dozens of classmates who managed to escape. It followed months of controversy in which the parents had sought a meeting. He finally agreed to the meeting after a request from Malala Yousafzai, the 17-year-old Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by Taliban militants in 2012 and won the Nobel peace prize this month for her campaigning for girls¡¯ right to an education.

Jonathan¡¯s principal secretary, Hassan Tukur, told Agence France-Presse on Friday that an agreement to end hostilities had been reached following talks, as well as a deal to release the 219 girls.

Tukur said he had represented the government at two meetings with the Islamist extremists in neighbouring Chad, mediated by that country¡¯s president, Idriss D?by. ¡°Boko Haram issued the ceasefire as a result of the discussions we have been having with them,¡± said Tukur. ¡°They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,¡± he added.

But there was uncertainty about the identity of Boko Haram¡¯s representative at the talks, named by Tukur as Danladi Ahmadu.

Multiple analysts cast doubt on Ahmadu¡¯s credibility as a Boko Haram envoy. Shehu Sani, a Boko Haram expert who has negotiated with the group before on behalf of the government, told AFP: ¡°I have never heard of such a man, and if Boko Haram wanted to declare a ceasefire, it would come from the group¡¯s leader, Abubakar Shekau.¡±

Ralph Bello-Fadile, an assistant to Nigeria¡¯s national security adviser (NSA), told a conference on Monday that it had been inundated with fraudsters claiming to represent Shekau. ¡°Government wants to negotiate, but so far nobody has come forward who speaks for Shekau,¡± he told a Chatham House event in Abuja.

Ahmadu gave an interview broadcast on Friday yesterday on the Hausa language service of Voice of America radio in which he claimed to be the group¡¯s chief security officer and in charge of publicity. He made no mention of an end to hostilities and was vague on details of the apparent talks, even claiming not to have met Shekau.

He also referred to the jihadi group as Boko Haram, a name that means ¡°western education is forbidden¡±. The name was imposed on the Islamist radicals by outsiders ? the insurgents themselves never use the term. Their leaders have exclusively used the name Jama¡¯atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda¡¯awati wal-Jihad, which means ¡°People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet¡¯s Teachings and Jihad¡±.

Boko Haram stormed the school in Chibok in April and snatched nearly 300 students, of whom 219 remain in captivity. This week about 50 protesters in red shirts tried to march to the presidential villa but were repeatedly diverted by riot police. The president has blamed activists for politicising the abductions and influencing the parents."

The video opens with a clip of President Barack Obama's remarks announcing the launch of airstrikes on Islamic State positions near Erbil in northern Iraq. A black screen then shows the text, """"A message to America,"""" and then Foley appears kneeling in a desert landscape, wearing an orange jumpsuit with a microphone attached. A hooded man wearing all-black clothes and tan military boots is standing behind him with a gun in a leather holster.

""""I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,"""" Foley says, among other things, in remarks seemingly prepared for him by his captors.

The video then switches to the man in black, who is now holding a serrated knife.

""""This is James Wright Foley ? an American citizen of your country,"""" the man says in British-accented English. """"As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards Islamic State.... Effectively, any aggression towards the Islamic State is an aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic Caliphate as their leadership. So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the safety of Muslims living under the safety of the Islamic Caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.""""

The man then beheads Foley, using the knife as the video fades to black. After a shot of Foley's lifeless body and decapitated head, the video switches to the executioner now standing behind another man in an orange jumpsuit, identified in text on the screen as Steven Joel Sotloff.

""""The life of this American prisoner, Obama, depends on your next decision.""""

Sotloff, an American freelance journalist who had been working for Time magazine among other publications, was kidnapped near the Syrian-Turkish border on Aug. 4, 2013.

The video then goes black.

The video was first reported by Zaid Benjamin, a reporter for the Arabic-language Radio Sawa, who said that it came from Furqan Media, the official outlet for the Islamic State. (Twitter suspended ? then reinstated ? the account.)

The video appeared to surface first on the Twitter account @mujahid4life, belonging to someone who described himself in his Twitter bio as 19 years old, """"anti-democracy. Loyal to the Caliphate. Harsh on kuffar. #Revert""""

It didn't take long before people who had worked with Foley began reacting on Twitter.

Pour water on their flame,"""" said a Tumblr blogger known as LibyaLiberty on Twitter in what appeared to be the first mention of the hashtag. """"From here on out, I won't share any photo or video of violence intentionally recorded & released by ISIS for propaganda,"""" she tweeted. Many others, promptly, joined her pledge.

Christian Bale is back in line to play Steve Jobs in a new biopic about the Apple co-founder after Leonardo DiCaprio backed out in order to take a break from acting.

The film industry magazine Variety reports that Bale will take the lead in the film Jobs, directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin, scriptwriter of The Social Network and The West Wing.

Based on Walter Isaacson¡¯s Steve Jobs: the Exclusive Biography, the film will be divided into three long scenes taking place in real time, each set on the eve of a product launch.

Since Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola, there have been 5,000 false alarms in the U.S., Forbes wrote Wednesday. The Centers for Disease Controls said it received more than 800 calls a day regarding the deadly disease -- a drastic jump from the 50 calls a day it received before Duncan¡¯s infection was known.

Duncan, the first person in the U.S. to become sick with virus, died Wednesday. ¡°It is with profound sadness and heartfelt disappointment that we must inform you of the death of Thomas Eric Duncan,¡± said a statement from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where he was being treated. ¡°He fought courageously in this battle.¡±

Unlucky in love Yang Hu was so fed up with not having a girlfriend that he chopped off his own penis -because he had no real use for it.

The depressed 26-year-old believed there was no chance of ever finding a partner due to his long work hours.

So in desperation he cut off his penis in a bid to stop himself thinking about finding love.

Realising his mistake Yang CYCLED to hospital to get treatment only to be sent home by shocked doctors who told him to retrieve his severed penis so they could attempt to reattach it.

However, when he returned he had lost too much blood and so surgeons were unable to save it.

Yang's friends said that he had been increasingly depressed about the fact that since moving to the city he could not find a girlfriend.

They said that his long hours working in a clothing factory in Jiaxing, in Zhejiang province in east China, meant he he doubted he would ever have a chance to meet a woman."
461,"Fourteen more police arrested as forensic investigators find no trace of students missing since violent confrontation in Guerrero

Authorities testing remains found in nine mass graves in southern Mexico say they are yet to find any trace of 43 students who disappeared after a confrontation with police.

None was among 28 bodies, some badly burned, that were unearthed a week after the 26 September attack, said the attorney general, Jes?s Murillo Karam.

Forensic investigators continued to test other remains and announced the discovery of a 10th mass grave on Tuesday. An additional 14 police officers had been arrested and confessed to participating in the disappearance, Karam said, bringing the total number of detainees to 50.

The 14 are from the police force of Cocula, a town neighbouring Iguala, where the confrontation took place in the southern state of Guerrero. Both the mayor and police chief of Iguala are fugitives and accused of links to the local drug cartel, Guerrero Unidos, believed to have worked with police in taking the students. The gang controls drug routes in Guerrero and Morelos states.

Karam said officials had yet to identify the masterminds or a motive in the attack but the collusion might have gone beyond just one town. ¡°There¡¯s a connection. We will determine if it was coordination or subordination, but it¡¯s clear to me that they were working together,¡± he said of police and drug traffickers in the area.

Police opened fire on about 100 teaching college students who had hijacked buses to return to campus after arriving in Iguala

Six people were killed, 25 wounded and dozens of students rounded up by police. There has been no sign of the missing in nearly three weeks, despite investigators combing the clandestine burial sites outside Iguala, where drug cartels are believed to dump their enemies.

On Tuesday, the Guerrero governor, Angel Aguirre, said many of the bodies at the first site appeared to have been buried for some time, suggesting they belonged to earlier victims of criminal gangs.

¡°Some of them are not recent, some are from months ago,¡± Aguirre told MVS radio.

One forensic expert, who works with federal investigators, said identification was an arduous, time-consuming process. Charred remains like those recovered at the first mass graves could leave very little DNA for testing.

Hundreds of teachers, students and relatives of the missing marched peacefully to the centre of the state capital, Chilpancingo, on Tuesday after a night of angry protests and vandalism that badly damaged the state capital building.

They lined up in silence as organisers handed out white flowers. Some carried candles with a sprawling billboard offering a 1m peso (?47,000) reward for information.

On Monday, protesters demanding to know the whereabouts of the missing smashed windows at the state capital building complex in Chilpancingo, 132 miles south of Mexico City, and set fire to buildings."
462,"Throughout the three-plus years of the Syrian civil war, one oft-sung refrain among some American officials has been that arming Syrian moderates (whoever they may be) is a dicey proposition because the weapons ""could fall into the wrong hands.""

Despite these objections, the United States eventually sent military aid to the Free Syrian Army last year. The policy change was precipitated by Syrian dictator Bashar Assad's violation of the Obama administration's ""red line"" after the regime used chemical weapons against civilians.

Last month, with the rise of ISIS in mind, Congress approved the president's plan to to train and arm the Syrian rebels. There was some familiar dissent at the time. ""How will we ensure that the United States weapons we are providing to Syrian rebels will not get into the wrong hands, as they did with the rebels we supported in Libya?"" Representative Barbara Lee asked.

On the same day as that vote, Islamic State fighters first encircled Kobani, a Syrian town near the Turkish border, attacking the largely Kurdish town and inspiring vigorous American airstrikes. On Monday, hoping to decisively turn the tide in the battle, the United States airdropped weapons to the Syrian Kurds of Kobani. By way of explanation, especially to a skeptical Turkish audience, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry offered that not aiding the Kurds in their fight against ISIS is both ""irresponsible"" and ""morally very difficult.""

Unfortunately, with that one airdrop, the weight of the American dread about where its weapons might go also landed. According to the Associated Press, some of the weapons meant to reach the Kurds ended up in Islamic State hands instead.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State.
The Associated Press said the video was consistent with other reporting. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, British activist group, added that more than one cache of weapons might have been snatched up by Islamic State fighters.

Of course, this wouldn't be the first time that Islamic State fighters have captured American weapons. This might just have been the easiest."
464,"Amazon, the cyber store that sells everything, plans to open its first physical store at 7 W 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan just in time for the holiday season. The experimental store will work as a mini-warehouse for some same day deliveries in New York. It'll surely serve as a nice little billboard, too.

The new brick-and-mortar shop is actually across the street from the Empire State Building, so it's clearly primo real estate. That's surely why analysts think that Amazon is opening the space as a marketing effort. It doesn't hurt that the company will be able to show off its (now sizable) lineup of products, including Kindles of all kinds and the new Fire phone. The store will also handle pick-ups and returns.

This is not the first time that Amazons's toyed with the idea of a physical presence, however. Rumors were rampant a couple of years ago that the company was going to open a similar-sounding store in Seattle. But hey, why open a store in a small city, when you can open a warehouse at the foot of the Empire State Building. [WSJ]

467,"Crews removed a time capsule dating back to 1795 on Thursday from the granite cornerstone of the Massachusetts Statehouse, where historians believe it was originally placed by Revolutionary War luminaries Samuel Adams and Paul Revere among others.

The small time capsule is believed to contain items such as old coins, documents, newspapers and a metal plate that was owned by Revere.

Secretary of State William Galvin speculated that some of the items could have deteriorated over time.

Official plan to X-ray the capsule on Sunday at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts to get some idea of the contents and possibly details on their condition, then open it next week.

Scroll down for video

Originally made of cowhide, the time capsule was believed to have been embedded in the cornerstone when construction on the state Capitol began in 1795. Adams was governor of Massachusetts at the time.

The time capsule was removed in the mid-19th century and its contents transferred to a copper box, Galvin said. Its removal Thursday was due to an ongoing water filtration project at the building. Galvin said the plan is to return it to the site sometime next year.

Pamela Hatchfield, a conservator at the museum, was exhausted Thursday after spending hours chiseling and drilling on the massive cornerstone, taking care not to damage the time capsule or coins that were thrown in the mortar that held it in place.

She held up the capsule for viewing by state officials, reporters and contractors involved in the renovation of the Statehouse.

'It's heavy,' Hatchfield said. 'I feel happy and relieved and excited and really interested to see what's in this box.'

Hatchfield said state officials did not know that the time capsule was embedded in the cornerstone until 60 years after some of the nation's leading founding political figures put it there.

'It was first put in there in 1795 by Paul Revere and Sam Adams and was unearthed accidentally when in 1855 there were some amendments to the building,' Hatchfield said. 'They put the contents back into a new box and placed it in a depression in the stone, which is on the underside.'

Galvin said there were notes from 1855 indicating that officials washed some of the contents in the capsule with acid before putting them in the new copper box.

It also was a humid day when the items were restored and, Galvin said, the corner of the Statehouse where the capsule was fixed has had a water leakage problem for 30 years.

The Massachusetts Statehouse is one of the oldest, active statehouses in the country

'We have to see what held up since that time,' he said. 'That's the biggest question we have right now ? are the contents in good condition or not?'

Galvin said the Massachusetts Statehouse is one of the oldest, active statehouses in the country.

'Obviously, when we talk about the original box being presided over by then-Gov. Sam Adams, Paul Revere, it's pretty significant,' he said. 'I'm very fond of saying ... that the history of Massachusetts is the history of America, and it's very true and this is another evidence of that.'

The excavation came just months after another time capsule was uncovered from the Old State House, which served as the state's first seat of government. That long-forgotten time capsule, dating to 1901, turned up in a lion statue atop the building and, when opened, was found to contain a potpourri of well-preserved items including newspaper clippings, a book on foreign policy and a letter from journalists of the period."
468,"The state of North Dakota has named a new publicly-owned landfill after President Barack Obama.

In an overwhelming 35-10 vote, the state Senate advanced a bill naming a 650-acre site currently under construction after the nation¡¯s 44th president. Governor Jack Dalrymple is expected to sign the measure into law Tuesday.

When completed, the Barack Obama Memorial Landfill will be the largest waste disposal site in North Dakota, and the 17th largest in the United States. It will be especially rich in toxic waste from the local petroleum and medical industries.

¡°We wanted to do something to honor the president,¡± says Republican State Senator Doug Perlman, who was the lead sponsor of the bill. ¡°And I think a pile of garbage is a fitting tribute to Obama¡¯s presidency.

¡°We originally planned on naming it after a nearby mountain. But then someone jokingly suggested we name it after Obama. I never thought and idea like that would actually pass. But I was pleasantly surprised.¡±

The president is hardly popular in North Dakota. The most recent poll in December 2013 found that Obama has a 35% approval rating in the state, although that figure may have fallen further in the year since. Yet even considering the political climate, seasoned observers are surprised that two Democratic lawmakers voted for the bill¡¯s passage.

¡°I supported Obama because I thought he would end the wars in the Middle East;¡± says Allison Mitchell, a progressive Democrat from Grand Forks. ¡°But he decided to fight new wars abroad instead of fighting for single-payer health care and jobs here at home.

¡°I guess people expected me to oppose this landfill thing because I¡¯m a Democrat. But honestly I don¡¯t really care anymore. Maybe this small act of protest will wake him up.¡±

Ordinary citizens in the state also seem to approve of the government¡¯s choice.

¡°I can¡¯t think of a better name,¡± says Joe Blough, a plumber from Minot. ¡°It¡¯s darkly colored and it's full of shit. That pretty much sums up Obama.¡±"
470,"Though Apple was mum about battery life for its forthcoming wrist-worn accessory when it was announced on Tuesday, the company has since said that it expects people to charge it nightly, suggesting the battery life will offer about one day of operation.

""""There's a lot of new technology packed into Apple Watch and we think people will love using it throughout the day,"""" Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris said in a statement to Re/code. """"We anticipate that people will charge nightly, which is why we designed an innovative charging solution that combines our MagSafe technology and inductive charging.""""

But sources who spoke with John Paczkowski went further, and indicated that the company isn't happy with the current uptime of the Apple Watch. One person said the watch's battery life is currently """"about a day,"""" and that the company is working on modifications ahead of its launch to improve it.

A one-day battery life is about on par with other touchscreen smart watches currently available on the market, including devices running the competing Android Wear platform.

The uptime stands in contrast to less powerful smart watches, like the Pebble, which utilizes a monochrome black-and-white display and lacks a touchscreen. Pebble's low-power screen is always on and provides up to a week of use before the wrist-borne device needs to be recharged.

Battery life for the Apple Watch remains somewhat up in the air because the product isn't yet finalized and ready for launch. Apple revealed on Tuesday that the wearable device will launch at some time in early 2015, but declined to offer a more specific window.

The company was also vague on other aspects of the hardware, including pricing. While the Apple Watch will start at $349, a breakdown of how much various models will cost was not given.

While the Apple Watch will start at $349, it's possible that the high-end models could reach into a five-figure price point. The luxury Apple Watch Edition is made of hardened 18-karat gold, and existing 18-karat gold watches typically sell for more than $10,000."
472,"American and British intelligence officials are eyeing a British-born rapper as the militant who beheaded journalist James Foley.

U.S. intelligence officials are not commenting publicly on the reports, but a well-placed source told Fox News that Bary's Egyptian-born father was extradited from London to the United States in 2012 for his alleged connection to Usama bin Laden and the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa.

Bary traveled to Syria last year to fight with  ISIS, the source said.

The Sunday Times and Sunday People identified Bary as a member of a group of at least three British-born ISIS fighters known among former hostages as ""The Beatles.""

474,"Eran Cicurel, an editor at Voice of Israel, has quoted YPG fighters familiar with the situation in Kobani, saying that Gill Rosenberg was not captured by IS. Cicurel's claims contradict IS claims, which made announcements on IS-affiliated websites Samoach al-Islam, al-Platform Media, and Twitter that Rosenberg had been captured.

Earlier in the day, IS media sources even alleged that a video was coming soon. Considering the scale of yesterday's IS advance, the story appeared plausible. Close friends, comrades, and supporters also voiced credible concern on Rosenberg's Facebook page.

The YPG fighters noted, through Cicurel, that Rosenberg was not in the city of Hoban at the time that IS claims she was abducted. They also called the story ""mere propaganda"". While not a confirmation per se, Cicurel's claims, in addition to circumstantial evidence, have made the story of Rosenberg's capture implausible.

Established Israeli sources exclusively ran the story purporting to be primary sources of reporting Rosenberg's capture. The Haaretz Israeli News, the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post, and Ynet News almost immediately published similar reports, while media outside Israel have either not reported on the story or quoted the Israeli media. It is illegal for an Israeli citizen to travel to an Israeli-declared hostile state, including Iraq and Syria, for any reason including business and media reporting.

Rosenberg, age 31, has become infamous in recent months for joining YPG fighters in Kobani despite the illegality of her endeavor. In the past 24 hours, an IS advance pushed the YPG back on four fronts, including the northern side that borders Turkey. However, the YPG has mitigated many IS gains, due to US airstrikes and the arrival of Turkish forces sealing the border to the north.

Despite the new information, little is still publicly known about Rosenberg's status at this time. Pro-IS sources are still claiming that she is captured, while other sources are staying quiet. A link will be added in the comments if the story is officially confirmed or denied.

475,"When you complain to your cable company, you certainly don¡¯t expect that the cable company will then contact your employer and discuss your complaint. But that¡¯s exactly what happened to one former Comcast customer who says he was fired after the cable company called a partner at his accounting firm.

IT BEGAN INNOCENTLY ENOUGH¡¦

Conal began subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013 after he says he was sold a 9-month promotional pricing offer. But from the start, there were issues with his service, as he was being charged for set-top boxes that had yet to be activated. Additionally, someone at Comcast billing had misspelled Conal¡¯s last name, meaning some of his bills were not being delivered.

He says he met with a Comcast rep in May 2013 about the billing issues and promised they would all be sorted out, but things only got worse.

A few months later, the promotional discount shrunk and Conal¡¯s monthly bill increased by $20, in addition to still being charged for unactivated devices in his house. Comcast also twice charged him an additional $7 for a second modem he did not have.

Meanwhile, attempts to get a resolution from Comcast went unanswered.

CUTTING THE CORD

He attempted to cancel his service in Oct. 2013 but says a Comcast rep convinced him that the billing issues would be resolved and that he would get free DVR service and The Movie Channel for three months as compensation.

But things didn¡¯t just continue as they had before; Comcast somehow managed to sink even lower than it had before, sending Conal about a dozen pieces of equipment that he didn¡¯t order.

¡°There were a few DVRs, modem, standard boxes and equipment that I was unfamiliar with,¡± he says.

Making matters worse, Comcast billed him $1,820 for all this stuff he¡¯d never requested and had no use for.

When Conal returned all the equipment to Comcast and, being an experienced accountant at one of the nation¡¯s most prestigious firms, even prepared a spreadsheet detailing every charge, overcharge, payment and credit on his account for his brief time as a Comcast customer.

He says even this didn¡¯t convince Comcast that there was a problem and that Conal had been overcharged. And even though it wasn¡¯t yet past due, Comcast sent Conal¡¯s account into collections in Feb. 2014.

THE CALL IN QUESTION

And so on Feb. 6, 2014, he chose to try going above Comcast¡¯s customer service, which hadn¡¯t been of any help in the year he¡¯d been a subscriber, and instead contacted the office of the company¡¯s Controller. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues.

He describes that callback as ¡°bizarre,¡± with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with ¡°How can I help you?¡± Then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment, but wouldn¡¯t specify which appointment. The rep then began asking him for the color of his house.

So he tried the Controller¡¯s office again, to let them know that the rep they¡¯d sent his way had failed miserably at her job.

During this call, he says that he mentioned that Comcast¡¯s billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation. This ultimately led to two service calls where no one ever showed up and no explanations were given.

But something did happen. Just not anything good.

WE KNOW WHERE YOU WORK

Remember how we briefly mentioned above that Conal worked for a large, prestigious accounting firm? Comcast certainly noticed that fact, especially since that firm is one that does business with Comcast.

At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal¡¯s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he¡¯d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.

Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controller¡¯s office looked him up online and figured out where he worked.

When he was fired, Conal¡¯s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.

But Conal has never seen this e-mail in order to say whether it¡¯s accurate and Comcast has thus far refused to release any tapes of the phone calls related to this matter.

And while his former employer did provide consulting services to Comcast, it was not the accounting firm that audited Comcast¡¯s books. So Conal doesn¡¯t quite see how mentioning the name of his employer would have helped gain him any leverage.

In response to a letter from Conal¡¯s lawyer ? he has not filed a lawsuit, but it¡¯s not out of the question ? Comcast¡¯s Senior Deputy General Counsel admits that the company did contact Conal¡¯s employer but says that Conal ¡°is not in a position to complain that the firm came to learn¡± about his dispute with Comcast.

THE HEART OF THE MATTER

I think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controller¡¯s office.

Had the billing issues been fixed on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth chance that he gave Comcast to address the issue, the call in question would never have happened.

And even if Conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed, he wouldn¡¯t have been trying to get preferential treatment; just the service he¡¯d paid for.

I¡¯m also curious why, even though Comcast insists that Conal attempted to leverage his place of business to get his issue resolved, it has not specifically cited language that he allegedly used in the call.

How many times a day do Comcast reps hear a customer say something like ¡°I¡¯m a lawyer¡± or ¡°I¡¯m a big shot at [fill in the blank]¡°? How many of those result in Comcast going out of its way to contact that customer¡¯s employer?

We reached out to Comcast to ask whether it¡¯s company policy to contact customers¡¯ employers. No one answered that question, but a rep for Comcast did give a brief statement.

¡°Our customers deserve the best experience every time they interact with us,¡± reads the statement. Comcast says it has previously apologized to Conal, but adds ¡°we will review his lawyer¡¯s letter and respond as quickly as possible.¡±"

In a statement, National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said that if the video is genuine they are """"appalled by the brutal murder."""" 

""""We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity.

Foley, 40, grew up in New Hampshire and was originally a teacher, at one point teaching prison inmates in Arizona, before attending the Medill school of journalism at Northwestern University. After graduation, his first assignment was as an embed with the U.S. Army¡¯s 173rd Brigade and 101st Airborne Division in Afghanistan.  Foley had been covering the Syria's civil war for GlobalPost and Agence France-Presse (AFP) when he was allegedly pulled from the car he was traveling in to meet with a colleague and abducted at gunpoint. According to the Columbia Journalism Review, GlobalPost hired an international security firm for a ground level investigation in Northern Syria and along the Turkish border to locate him.

Foley was also detained and held for 44 days in Libya in 2011.

482,"Lucita Sandoval was not involved in a sex tape scandal after a newspaper unearthed the truth following internet gossip sites that were filled with reports of the story

A graphic sex video that has been shared across South America after rumours emerged that it involved a female teacher and her teenage pupil has been exposed as a fake.

The footage was shared by thousands of people in Argentina after false reports came out that it showed a woman called Lucita Sandoval from the city of Santiago del Estero with a 16-year-old boy.

Internet gossip sites incorrectly stated that Miss Sandoval was a teacher and was secretly filmed by a grinning pupil of hers.

It has since emerged that the woman in the video is not Miss Sandoval, but a completely different woman from the city of Corrientes in Argentina.

And reports that she engaged in sexual antics with a school pupil proved to be false too, after it was revealed the young man in the video is a college student.

It was also falsely reported that the 'teacher' has several times faced disciplinary hearings over inappropriate relationships with pupils

An Argentinian newspaper investigated the claims, and found that no such woman exists and the video appears to be a private sex tape that was shared via Whatsapp and then uploaded to a hardcore porn website."

Ferguson: An audio recording released on Tuesday morning may shed light on the death of a Missouri teenager fatally shot by a police officer August 9, which have sparked protests that resumed this week.

The tape, provided to CNN, allegedly contains audio captured during a Ferguson resident's video chat at the time of the shooting. CNN says the authenticity of the tape has yet to be verified, but what appears to be gunfire can be heard in the background of the call.

As many as 10 shot-like sounds can be heard. Several shots are fired in what appears to be fairly quick succession. There is a brief pause, then more shots are fired.

An autopsy concluded that Michael Brown, 18, was shot six times, with two fatal shots to the head. The Ferguson officer involved has been identified as Darren Wilson, 28.

Law enforcement officials and bystanders have provided differing accounts of what led to the fatal encounter. Police say Mr Wilson stopped Brown and a friend for walking in the street, asking the two to move to the sidewalk, and words were exchanged. According to Mr Wilson's account, he was attacked by Brown as he attempted to exit his cruiser and the two scuffled for the officer's gun inside the car.

Both Mr Wilson and witnesses concede Brown took off running. The witnesses say the officer fired on the unarmed teen as he had his hands up to surrender. Wilson supporters say Brown was bull-rushing Wilson, who shot Brown in self-defense.

The shooting ignited racial tensions, sparking several days and nights of protests, riots, looting and unrest, which have resumed.

More than 100 demonstrators marched in St. Louis on Tuesday demanding the arrest of a white police officer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri.

The protesters, who called for Mr Wilson's arrest and the removal of Ferguson police leaders, were blocked from walking up the courthouse steps by a group of officers, most on bicycles.

Few signs were visible at what has been the centre of the protests along West Florissant in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb.

A man under a gazebo sold T-shirts that read ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" the chant favoured by demonstrators, as the temperature reached 34 Celsius at midday.

People gathered in small groups at the impromptu memorial set up where Brown died and two women handed out food from a folding table.

""This community has had a story to tell for a long time and this has just been the catalyst,"" said Chelsea Warlick, 29, a photographer from Savannah, Georgia. The majority of people in Ferguson are black, while most of its elected officials and police force are white.

Ms Warlick, who laid white roses by the memorial, said she was about to sign a six-month lease on an apartment in the complex where Brown lived to support the community.

""The verdict is everything. If he doesn't go to jail for what he did this place is going to burn,"" she said of Mr Wilson.

The Missouri National Guard, which began a gradual pullout from Ferguson on Friday, was absent from a spot on West Florissant they had occupied late on Monday.

Brown's funeral service was Monday, and the case is currently being presented to a grand jury. Attorney General Eric Holder has promised a thorough investigation.

The organisation Black Lawyers for Justice plans to file a $US200 million class action lawsuit against Ferguson authorities Tuesday, KDSK-TV reported. According to the organisation's website, the group's mission is to fight police brutality.

484,"OTTAWA - The man who is reported to have shot an assailant on Parliament Hill today is a former police officer with a background in providing security services for dignitaries, including members of the Royal Family.

Kevin Vickers became the sergeant-at-arms in the House of Commons eight years ago after a varied career in security.

He spent 29 years with the RCMP and rose to the rank of chief superintendent, often serving as the face of the national police force in New Brunswick.

The 58-year-old was appointed director of security operations for the House of Commons in June 2005.

He had previously worked as aide-de-camp for New Brunswick's lieutenant-governor.

The sergeant-at-arms is responsible for safeguarding the authority of the House of Commons, as well as the safety and security of the Parliament buildings.

As an RCMP officer, Vickers has been responsible for security services provided for the Queen and Prince Andrew.

On Twitter, MPs credited Vickers with saving their lives.

""MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,"" tweeted New Democrat Craig Scott.

Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino tweeted: ""I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe."""
487,"With Apple's media event just a week away and the company expected to offer final details there on the Apple Watch ahead of its April debut, The New York Times has a new report out sharing a few new tidbits on the device.

Among the interesting details is the existence of an unannounced ""Power Reserve"" mode for the watch that will display only the time and cut off all other functions as the battery begins to run critically low, preserving the most basic functionality of the watch. The report also notes that while the Apple Watch has been widely tested by Apple employees, the company did work to conceal many of those prototypes by disguising them to resemble Samsung smartwatches.

Sources have also provided more context to a Wall Street Journal article from last month that discussed how many of the originally planned health features for Apple Watch were dropped due to consistency issues. According to The New York Times' sources, the decision to drop many of those features came more than 18 months ago, refuting off-target reports in recent weeks claiming the cuts have come at the last minute.Nearly two years ago, the company experimented with advanced health monitoring sensors that tracked blood pressure and stress, among other variables. Many of those experiments were abandoned more than 18 months ago after the sensors proved unreliable and cumbersome, these people said.

Apple long ago decided that for the first version of the product, it would include a heart rate sensor and a sensor for tracking movement, to market the device as a fitness-tracking companion to the iPhone. Previous reports have indicated Apple is still working on those technologies, and they could appear in future versions of the Apple Watch.

Today's report reveals some additional insight into the development process, noting that the Apple Watch is coming a bit later than originally hoped due to technical challenges that were likely exacerbated by the loss of several engineers working on the project. Google's Nest Labs, headed by iPod pioneer Tony Fadell, was responsible for poaching several of the key Apple Watch employees.

Apple's media event will take place at 10:00 AM Pacific Time on Monday, March 9 at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. The company will offer a live video stream of the event, and MacRumors will provide full coverage of the event.

Dramatic footage has emerged of a US marine being shot in the head by a Taliban sniper, only to be saved by his Kevlar helmet.

The video was captured on the helmet camera of a marine in 2013, when he and two other marines were taking part in a reconnaissance mission in the NawZad district of the renowned Helmand Province, Afghanistan.

The video begins with the team searching a compound; however, when they hear gunfire they decide to investigate where it is coming from.

After walking through a tunnel the team fall quiet, before the silence is broken by the sound of a sniper¡¯s bullet ricocheting off one of the marine¡¯s Kevlar helmets.

The team quickly fall back to safety using the radio to explain what has just happened.

When in a safe area, the bewildered marine asks, ¡°What just happened?¡±

¡°Dude, you got shut¡± the marine with the camera tells him, ¡°I saw it hit your Kevlar.¡±

The marine then complains that his ears are ringing, before inspecting the damage that the bullet caused to his helmet.

Following, the lucky escape the team then attempts to locate the sniper before the filming stops.

Tokyo: Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader who has mysteriously been missing from the public eye for almost a month, sparking rumours ranging from a stroke to a coup d'etat, is apparently just recovering from ankle surgery.

Mr Kim had fractured both of his ankles and had surgery in Pyongyang in the middle of September to treat them, the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea's largest newspaper, reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source.

""""I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,"""" the source said, adding that the leader had had the operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.

Such is the fascination with North Korea, the world's most impenetrable country, that rumours spread like wildfire. But they are almost always impossible to verify.

Nevertheless, it is true that Mr Kim has become noticeably more rotund since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father, Kim Jong-il, in December 2011. He was pictured limping in July during a ceremony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of his grandfather, former North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, causing speculation about his health.

But the gossip mill started up again last week when Mr Kim, the third-generation leader of North Korea, missed a regular session of the Supreme People's Assembly in Pyongyang. He has not been seen in public since September 3, when he attended a concert with his wife. The rumours went into overdrive when the state-run Korean Central TV said the """"Great Successor"""" was in an """"indisposed condition"""".

""""Despite some discomfort, our Marshal continues to come out and lead the people,"""" said the narrator of a documentary called Improving the Lives of the People, showing footage of Kim limping through the Taedonggang Tile Factory last month.

Outside commentators have guessed that Mr Kim has gout, which runs in the family, or has been drinking and eating too much. Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence.

Weibo, China's version of Twitter, went crazy this week with reports that Jo Myong Rok, a North Korean vice-marshal who died four years ago, had overthrown Kim in a coup and sent his lieutenants to South Korea for negotiations. Talk spread so quickly that the Global Times, one of China's official papers, ran a commentary on Monday titled: """"For those who make up rumours of coup in North Korea, is it so funny?""""

The unauthenticated audio was recorded by a man who says he was taping a video chat conversation when the shooting of the unarmed black teen by a white police officer occurred around noon on Saturday, Aug. 9.

CNN said it could not independently verify the authenticity of the audio. The man's attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, said that her client discussed the tape with the FBI. The FBI has yet to comment on whether it questioned the man who made the recording.

""""He heard loud noises and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards,"""" Blumenthal told CNN's Don Lemon. """"It just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.""""

On the audio, a man can be heard video-chatting a friend while shots ring out in the background. After a pause in the gunfire, more shots can be heard.

A forensic audio expert told the network that he detected a cluster of six gunshots followed by four more after the pause on the recording. A private autopsy ordered by Brown's family found last week that the unarmed teen had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head."

A CBC News still shows Vickers holding the gun and walking through the House of Commons' moments after taking down the assailant.

Vickers has been the House of Commons' head of security since 2005 and will now go down in history as one of its most memorable after he bravely pursued and took down Zehaf-Bibeau.

In control: Vickers, who worked for the RCMP for 29 years before taking on the role, is being hailed a hero

Despite working for the RCMP for three decades, relatives said the incident was the first time in his career that Vickers had ever shot anyone.

Riveting video taken inside Ottawa's House of Commons on Wednesday makes startlingly real just how heart-thumpingly dangerous the situation was that Vickers heroically diffused.

A rush of armed police can be seen running toward an unseen suspect as the video from Globe and Mail opens.

At the head of the pack is a man moving swiftly with his gun in hand toward Zehaf-Bibeau, who had moments before murdered a reservist who stood guard at Canada's Tomb of the Unknown soldier.

The death of that man, a 24-year-old father of a young son, Nathan Cirillo, would soon be avenged as Vickers takes aim inside the cavernous parliamentary building and fires off multiple shots.

As those shots echo throughout the hall, the video goes wobbly as the men behind their leader Vickers move for cover.

'MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,' tweeted New Democrat MP Craig Scott.

Matt Miller, the Vancouver Observer's parliamentary bureau chief, concurred.

'Kevin is definitely a hero,' Miller told CNN.

Vickers has honed his peacekeeping skills over a prestigious 28-year career as a member Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

And peacekeeping is the word. According to his brother, Wednesday's showdown was Vickers' first exchange of gunfire with a suspect in his nearly three-decade long career.

'For it now to happen at Parliament ... is unbelievable,' John Vickers told CNN. 'We're just relieved he's OK.'

His sister, Mary, added to the Sun News: 'We're always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him - he had to make a very serious decision today.'

'He's always a natural leader. He would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can't stress that enough - but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.'

Vickers serves a largely ceremonial role at the House of Commons, carrying a scepter and wearing rich green robes, white gloves and a tall imperial tricorne hat.

A fit, tall 6-foot-4, Vickers spends many of his lunch breaks running in order to stay fit. He also carries a 9mm pistol while at work.

Both things appeared to come in extremely handy while Vickers took down the parliament terrorist Wednesday.

'It's Kevin being Kevin,' his cousin Keith told CBC. 'He's a very intelligent and responsible person. He's a people person-type fellow, too, but you don't want to mess with him.'

On Thursday, flags were flown at half-mast across Canada as a shocked and still fearful Ottawa awoke.

Vickers - already back in work - was greeted by a standing ovation from parliament. Humbly nodding his head, the police veteran received handshakes from leading politicians.

Vickers received a standing ovation from MPs in the House of Commons on Thursday when he returned to the more usual duty of delivering the ceremonial mace to the chamber

Vickers remained mostly expressionless during the ovation before briefly appearing close to tears, and eventually acknowledging the applause with several nods of thanks

He released a statement paying tribute to Nathan Cirillo and revealed another police officer was shot in the leg.

'I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday¡¯s events. However, I have the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of Members, employees and visitors to the Hill,' he said.

'On behalf of all members of the House of Commons Security Services team, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo. Our prayers are with you. Our thoughts are also with Constable Samearn Son, who has been with the House of Commons Security Services for 10 years. Constable Son suffered a gun shot wound to the leg. He is in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.'

Earlier in the morning, a man was arrested for getting too close to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his wife Laureen as they placed flowers at the scene of the shooting.

Armed officers ordered the unidentified man to the ground for 'disturbing the crime scene' after he was warned not to cross the crime tape but did.

On Wednesday evening Harper addressed his nation from an undisclosed location and condemned the horrific actions but vowed his country's foreign policy would not be thrown off course.

'Canada will never be intimidated,' he said.

Queen Elizabeth released a statement to the country saying she was saddened by the events.

'Prince Philip and I were shocked and saddened by the events in Ottawa. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected' she said.

'I am writing this note on behalf of my husband and myself. No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time.

'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created.

'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don¡¯t understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don¡¯t know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in.

I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer.

We don¡¯t wish to be part of any media circus, we don¡¯t think it will add anything to the conversation. Please respect our privacy although many may not feel we deserve any ... Once again we are so sorry.'

Arrest: An unidentified man was arrested for disturbing the crime scene as security concerns are still high across Ottawa

Chilling footage appears to have caught the moment that gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau got into a hijacked car moments after shooting a soldier dead at Ottawa's War Memorial.

Footage from a dashcam appears to show the Muslim convert climb into the driver's side of a Toyota Corolla that - according to witnesses - he had stolen earlier.

Zehaf-Bibeau stormed the Parliament minutes later having abandoned the car in the street with the engine running after he had driven a short distance from the cenotaph.

A shoot-out with armed officials ensued, with Zehaf-Bibeau eventually shot dead by Vickers as shocked politicians and journalists barricaded themselves in rooms and cowered in corridors.

One eye witness said that as many as 30 shots were fired in the exchange, which took place just yards away from where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was speaking.

The 32-year-old had callously shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old father, in the stomach at point-blank range while he was on ceremonial duty.

Despite the desperate efforts of medics, Mr Cirillo succumbed to his injuries in hospital.

A witness told The Ottawa Citizen that he'd seen a man armed with a double-barrelled shotgun wearing a scarf 'hijack a car'.

He added: 'It was pretty intense.'"

But after cutting off his organ and throwing it in a bin, 22-year-old Oliver Ilic, was unable to stop the bleeding.

He called emergency services and was taken to a hospital in Kocani, Macedonia, where he told medics he had decided to cut it off because it was no use.

He explained his girlfriend had ended their relationship after telling him he was not good in bed.

Oliver Ilic, 22, from Macedonia, called for help after he was unable to stop the bleeding after he cut off his penis

Police searched his house and found the severed penis in a bin along with the razor blade he had used.

Local doctors were unable to reattach the organ and Mr Ilac was taken to another hospital in capital Skopje - where surgeons successfully reattached it in a five-hour operation.

But it is too early to know if Mr Ilac's penis will function properly again.

Another Macedonian man recently chopped off his own penis.

But unlike Mr Ilic, the man flushed it away in the toilet so it was not able to be reattached.

The man told medics he felt his small penis was to blame for the fact he had been dumped by his girlfriend, and as it was useless, decided to cut it off.

Oliver Ilic, 22, had called medics after he couldn¡¯t stop the bleeding and was taken on a stretcher in bloodstained jeans to hospital in the eastern Macedonian town of Kocani.

Police searched his house and discovered the severed organ in a bin after it had been cut off with a single swipe from a razor blade which was also in the bin.

After barrelling past the guard immediately inside the door, Gonzalez, who was carrying a knife, dashed past the stairway leading a half-flight up to the first family¡¯s living quarters. He then ran into the 80-foot-long East Room, an ornate space often used for receptions or presidential addresses.

Gonzalez was tackled by a counter-assault agent at the far southern end of the East Room. The intruder reached the doorway to the Green Room, a parlor overlooking the South Lawn with artwork and antique furniture, according to three people familiar with the incident.

Secret Service officials had earlier said he was quickly detained at the main entry. Agency spokesman Edwin Donovan said the office is not commenting due to an ongoing investigation of the incident.

So....they just lied?

On a related note, I wonder who the whistleblowers are that have been feeding all this stuff to WaPo's Carol Leonnig? Not that it matters, I suppose, but I'm curious about whether it's folks who are appalled by the security lapses or folks who have some other kind of axe to grind."

Huzlers.com claimed that the cause of the blackout was, 'due to a solar storm, which will cause dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus, block 90% sunlight.'

¡°Libya is now a source of danger not only for neighbouring Maghreb countries, but for all countries of the world,¡± said a Moroccan reporter shortly after news broke of the stolen jetliners.
According to veteran reporter Bill Gertz, U.S. officials said that they received intelligence indicating eleven commercial aircraft could be used to attack New York City or Washington, D.C. on the anniversary of the September, 11, 2001 jihadi attacks on America.

509,"BEIRUT (AP) ? Lebanese authorities detained a woman and young boy believed to be the wife and son of the reclusive Islamic State group leader, and were questioning the woman and conducting DNA tests on the child, senior Lebanese officials said Tuesday.

If their identities are confirmed, Lebanon may use the pair as bargaining chips to win the release of soldiers and police taken hostage by the extremists in cross-border attacks earlier this year.

The woman, who was identified as an Iraqi, and the child were taken into custody about 10 days ago while carrying fake ID cards, the officials said.

Very little is known about Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's personal life, including how many wives and children he has. Conservative interpretations of Islam allow men to marry up to four wives. The Islamic State group did not immediately comment on the detentions, but the faction's supporters on Twitter and militant websites cast doubt on the reports.

Adding to the confusion, the Lebanese army did not release an official statement regarding the pair.

A Lebanese military official identified the woman as Saja al-Dulaimi who was held by Syrian authorities and freed in a prisoner exchange with the Nusra Front, Syria's al-Qaida-linked branch, earlier this year. The official said the woman """"confessed during interrogation"""" that she was al-Baghdadi's wife.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.

In March, the Nusra Front freed more than a dozen Greek Orthodox nuns in exchange for the release of dozens of female prisoners by the Syrian government. A woman named Saja al-Dulaimi was reportedly on the list of prisoners freed by Damascus.

A judicial official said the interrogation of the woman was being supervised by Lebanon's military prosecutor, Saqr Saqr, and that a DNA test was underway to confirm that the child is her son. Experts said it would be difficult to confirm whether the woman is indeed al-Baghdadi's wife.

It was unclear what would have brought the woman and child to Lebanon, where IS controls no territory and enjoys only small ? although growing ? support in some predominantly Sunni Muslim areas.

The detentions added to the mystery that continues to surround al-Baghdadi, who has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head. He has only made one known public appearance ? a sermon he delivered in July at a mosque in Mosul just days after IS declared him the head of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the territory the group controls in Syria and Iraq.

Last month, Iraqi officials claimed he was wounded in an airstrike. The U.S. has not confirmed those reports, and al-Baghdadi released a new audiotape days after he was purportedly hit.

The Lebanese daily As-Safir first reported the detention of the Islamic State leader's alleged relatives, saying the woman and boy were taken into custody near a border crossing point with Syria. It said the arrest came in """"coordination with foreign intelligence agencies.""""

If the pair's identities are confirmed, the detentions could give Lebanese authorities leverage in their attempts to reach a prisoner-exchange deal with militants from the Islamic State group and the Nusra Front. The extremists have been holding more than 20 Lebanese soldiers and policemen hostage since August, and have demanded the release of Islamist prisoners held by Lebanon. On Monday night, the Nusra Front threatened to kill one of the soldiers it holds captive.

Lebanese troops have clashed repeatedly with militants along the border with Syria since August.

On Tuesday, militants ambushed a Lebanese army patrol near the frontier, killing six soldiers and wounding one, Lebanon's military said. The attack occurred in a remote region of Ras Baalbek in eastern Lebanon and was followed by clashes, the army said in a statement.

It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack, but there was no immediate indication that it was connected to the detention of al-Baghdadi's alleged family members.

Meanwhile, supporters of the Islamic State group released a video claiming responsibility for a shooting that wounded a Danish citizen in the Saudi capital of Riyadh last month.

The video, posted online Monday by the Al-Battar Media Foundation, shows a gunman pulling up beside a vehicle and firing five times at the man inside, identified as Thomas Hoepner. The video's authenticity could not be confirmed but it was posted on a website commonly used by militants.

Saudi security officials say a Danish man was shot while driving Nov. 22, and that he was treated for shoulder wounds. They did not release his name.

If confirmed, the shooting would be the first attack on foreigners in the kingdom carried out by Islamic State supporters. About a decade ago, al-Qaida militants seeking to topple the Western-allied monarchy launched a wave of attacks that killed scores of security forces and Westerners in Saudi Arabia.

The video also includes audio clips of Islamic State group leaders calling on supporters to launch attacks inside the kingdom.

In Brussels, Danish Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard told reporters Tuesday that """"the Dane is doing better.""""

Denmark and Saudi Arabia are part of the U.S.-led coalition conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.

The shop will likely be located near the entrance of the iconic Wonder Room, a 19,000-square-foot shopping hall that houses a wide selection of luxury jewelry and watch brands alongside a concept store and mezzanine wine bar.

Wonder Room at Selfridges in London houses fine jewelry and watches
A section of Selfridges located near the Wonder Room was boarded up earlier this month to allow for construction of the expected Apple Watch pop-up shop, sources say. The store-within-a-store concept will display various Apple Watch models and provide customers with a personalized shopping experience, potentially including One to One service for those interested in learning more about the wrist-worn device.

Apple is recruiting retail employees from nearby Apple Stores in London to fill Specialist vacancies at an upcoming Central London location, which is likely to be this Selfridges boutique. The pop-up shop is expected to be readied in time for the Apple Watch launch in April and will likely join Galeries Lafayette as one of multiple standalone Apple Watch stores that Apple plans to open throughout Europe.

Selfridges has the second-largest retail space in the United Kingdom behind competing high-end department store Harrods. The store offers a myriad of designer jewelry and accessories, such as watches, bracelets, earrings, necklaces, pendants and rings. With the Apple Watch positioned at least partially as a fashion item, the department store offers an ideal setting for the wrist-worn device to be displayed.

He did it again. Rapper Kanye West reprised his most infamous stunt at Sunday night's Grammy awards, taking the stage as Beck was accepting the album of the year award.

After this latest incident, organizers of the major awards shows like the Grammys, MTV Video Music Awards, People's Choice Awards and the Oscars have unanimously agreed to disinvite and bar West from their respective ceremonies. The television networks that air these awards programs also joined in the 'West boycott.'

While it is true that West created a stir at the 2015 Grammy Awards when he briefly interrupted Beck during the musician's acceptance speech (just as he had done to Taylor Swift in 2009), Kanye has not been banned from all future award shows.

The App Store's 'Top Apps' lists are well known to the smartphone-savvy public, but how apps make it into those lists is perhaps less understood. Today, one micro-blog shared photos under the heading """"It's Hard Being a Top App Worker,"""" publicly exposing the operations behind App Store rank-boosting (Ed: which I henceforth dub 'crank-boosting') labour. 

The expos?, shown in the picture, displays a 'Top App list worker' in their work place, which features a simple shelf containing hundreds of iPhone 5Cs. In a room filled with such workstations from one side to the other, mobile phone labour takes place at an industrial level. Simply put, a worker downloads (and deletes and downloads, etc.) an app to boost its rank on the App Store, calculated by how many times the app has been downloaded. One worker can operate as up to 100 unique users. 

Apple has previously adopted measures to deter crank-boosting in order to ensure fair rankings for developers and users. In 2014 November, Apple introduced a 1 yuan strategy to drop the threshold for users to download apps, also intended to negatively impact the crank-boosting industry. 

But as crank-boosting simulates genuine user activity, it is nearly impossible to detect or safeguard against. 

Users accustomed to comparing and contrasting apps before download may be unknowingly swayed by crank-boosted apps that have purchased their celebrity. Such sneaky, industrious operations are tricky to break."

CBI files case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh over forced castration IANS
The agency filed case against the Dera Sacha Sauda chief on Wednesday on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons and criminal intimidation under the Indian Penal Code, following an order by the Punjab and Haryana High Court.
Hansraj Chauhan, a former Dera follower, had filed a petition in the high court in 2012 alleging that he along with around 400 male devotees of the Dera were castrated inside the ashram on the orders of Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.
Disposing off the petition, the high court had ordered a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the case in December 2014. The court asked the CBI to file the first status report by 2 March.
Chauhan had demanded a CBI inquiry and compensation for the castration inside the ashram in 2000. Chauhan claimed that the castration of Dera followers was done by the chief through doctors employed in his hospital.
Chauhan said in his petition that he along with other devotees was castrated under false claims that they would be able to realise god through the Dera chief after their castration.
Haryana Police handed over the documents related to the incident to the CBI on 2 January. Haryana Police also provided documents related to seven other devotees of the Dera chief who also claimed to be castrated.
 

The Dera has dismissed the castration allegation. Gurmeet Ram Rahim, who is making his film debut with """"MSG: The Messenger of God"""", is also facing trial in connection with cases of murder of a journalist and sexual exploitation of his women disciples."
520,"The Islamist militant group Boko Haram has agreed to a ceasefire and the release of more than 200 kidnapped school girls, according to Nigerian officials. The girls were abducted six months ago from a school in Chibok.

Nigerian government officials claimed on Friday to have struck a two-part deal with Boko Haram, including a ceasefire and the release of 219 school girls, whose abduction last April sparked international outrage.
""""Boko Haram issued the ceasefire as a result of the discussions we have been having with them,"""" said Hassan Tukur, who represented the Nigerian government at talks with the militant organization in neighboring Chad. """"They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,"""" he continued
The girls have been missing for the past six months, despite international efforts mobilized by the Twitter hashtag campaign #BringBackOurGirls to rescue them from captivity. France, Great Britain and the United States have helped with the search for the girls, while China, Israel and other nations have also provided various forms of assistance.
Nearly 300 girls were kidnapped from a boarding school in the northeastern town of Chibok on April 14, but dozens managed to subsequently escape. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has been criticized by the girls' families for responding slowly to their abduction.

Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates to """"Western education is sacrilege,"""" seeks to impose a strict interpretation of Shariah law in northern Nigeria. During its early years, the Sunni militant group engaged in isolated skirmishes with Nigerian security forces. But after a bloody government crackdown in 2009, Boko Haram launched a broad insurgency. Last summer, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau declared a calipate in the areas under his forces control.
Boko Haram's insurgency has been characterized by a brutal campaign of bombings and shootings targeting Christian churches, Muslim mosques, schools, markets, bars, villages, police stations and even a UN building. An estimated 5,000 Nigerians have been killed and a further 300,000 displaced by the violence.
In 2013, the Nigerian government declared a state of emergency in the northeastern states of Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa. Amnesty International has accused the Nigerian military of war crimes, including extrajudicial killings, in its fight against Boko Haram. The United Nations and Human Rights Watch have also alleged that Nigeria's security forces have committed human rights abuses.
Nigeria's population of 177 million people is 50 percent Muslim and 40 percent Christian. Muslims are concentrated in the north and Christians in the south. The remaining 10 percent of the population practices indigenous beliefs.

521,"Apple apparently wanted its smartwatches to focus heavily on health-related features, but the company was forced to changed direction mid-development. According to The Wall Street Journal, the company originally envisioned a device that can monitor heart rate, blood pressure and stress levels (based on the conductivity of the skin). Unfortunately, the sensors they tested just didn't pass muster, which isn't entirely surprising, since we've reviewed plenty of wearables with patchy heart rate monitors in the past. The company's engineers found that hairy arms, dry skin and even how tightly the watch is worn can affect the results, and they didn't find a solution in time.

Apple Watch became known as a black hole within the company, the WSJ's sources said, as it continued sucking in resources for four years despite all the failures during testing. Its development slowed down once the company realized that a health-focused watch that meets its standards will be very hard to build at this time. The lineup of watches due out in April are a lot different from the original one Apple envisioned and are more of an iPhone companion with a much simpler pulse monitor and pedometer.

Still, the company's expecting to sell a ton, reportedly ordering around 6 million units from its Asian suppliers just for the first quarter. Half of those are the entry-level Apple Watch Sports, while the mid-tier stainless steel model makes up a third of that number. As for Cupertino's original vision, well, there's always a chance that we'll see it come to life in the coming years. The company has a good track record of substantially improving its devices after a debut model appears -- the first iPhone didn't have 3G.

Oh, wait¡¦ That¡¯s not what they were getting at, is it?

There have been no official corporate announcements determining if this will be a reality or not. But, after seeing this image spread, why wouldn¡¯t Durex look into this?

If there¡¯s anything that could get the population on the condom train it would have to be the PSL trend, right?

Sounds like an easy moneymaker to me, even if it¡¯s just a novelty.

524,"Apple would never lower itself to rubbing elbows with the unwashed masses at CES, but it does like to throw out a few announcements during the show to get under everyone¡¯s skin. Cupertino has been quiet thus far, but rumors are swirling about a 12-inch MacBook Air refresh, and this isn¡¯t just a spec bump. Apple is reportedly redesigning the iconic laptop to be even thinner with a higher resolution screen.
Sources inside the company who have used the prototype notebook (code named MacBook Stealth) say it will eschew many of the conventional laptop features in the name of advancing design. The current MacBook Air¡¯s taper toward the front edge, which gives them a very slim profile, but there¡¯s still space near the back for the power connector and full-sized USBs. The new Air, however, won¡¯t be thick enough for a USB port. Instead, Apple will start using the new type-c reversible connectors. There also won¡¯t be an SD card slot or a MagSafe power connector?even Apple¡¯s beloved Thunderbolt is taking a hike. USB will do it all.
MBA
The 12-inch laptop would be substantially smaller and lighter than the 13-inch model, and even slightly smaller than the 11-inch version. This is thanks to slimmer bezels and a slightly more compact keyboard with less separate between keys. 9to5Mac doesn¡¯t have details on exactly how high the resolution will be, but the current Airs are sitting at 1366 x 768 (11-inch) and 1440 x 900 (13-inch). Stepping it up to a Retina Display resolution of 2560 x 1600 (like the 13-inch Pro) would be amazing in the Air¡¯s form factor.

To be clear, all the images of this supposed notebook are renders created by 9to5Mac. This is still thoroughly in the rumor category, but it¡¯s a redesign we¡¯ve been expecting for a long time. The updated MacBook Air could be announced in mid-2015.

526,"Boston| 
A Catholic priest from Massachussetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal O¡¯neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival. With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.

The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered.

The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.

He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like ¡°Being of Light¡±.

¡°Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting¡± states the Catholic priest. ¡°She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother¡¯s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn¡¯t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!¡±

The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.
Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O¡¯neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the ¡°Holy Mother¡±.

¡°I wish to continue preaching¡± says the elderly cleric. ¡°I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman¡¦¡±

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed however, if they will allow Father O¡¯neal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston.

The Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Sean P. O¡¯Malley, made a public statement this morning stating that Father O¡¯neal suffered hallucinations linked to a near-death experience and that God clearly isn¡¯t a female.

527,"A hallucinogenic fungi has been found growing in the Queen¡¯s garden at Buckingham Palace after being discovered by gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh.

The television presenter unearthed the fungi at Buckingham Palace for an ITV gardening show called The Queen¡¯s Garden, and said: ¡°I won¡¯t be eating any of that.¡±

Titchmarsh came across the red and white spotted toadstool ? called Amanita muscaria, or fly agaric ? on a tour of the private 40-acre plot with ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley.

Titchmarsh, 65, asks in an ITV show to be screened on Christmas Day: ¡°Is it edible?¡±

Professor Crawley replies: ¡°That depends what you mean. It¡¯s eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic affects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick.

¡°The old-fashioned thing to do was to feed it to the village idiot, then drink his urine because you get all of the high without any of the sickness.¡±

Titchmarsh jokingly replies: ¡°I think I¡¯ll forgo that and stick to normal mushrooms.¡±

Then he adds: ¡°Not something to try at home.¡±

Later he told The Sun newspaper: ¡°That was a surprise but it shows just how varied the species are. I won¡¯t be eating any of that, though, no. My idea of hard drugs is Nurofen.¡±

On the new TV show, Titchmarsh explains that gardeners actively encourage mushrooms and toadstools.

He says: ¡°Every time they chop something down, they leave out the wood to rot.¡±

Magic mushroom is a slang term for any hallucinogenic fungus.

The most common, illegal form contains drug psilocybin, but there is no suggestion this grows in the Palace garden.

Last night a Palace spokesman told the Sun: ¡°For the avoidance of doubt, fungi from the garden are not used in the Palace kitchens.¡±

The new programme will show viewers an entire year in the life of the Buckingham Palace garden, from the summer garden parties to the nocturnal wanderings of wildlife in the heart of London.

It will demonstrate how gardeners work tirelessly to maintain the Queen¡¯s flowers, while bearing in mind her wish to see animals and insects made welcome in the gardens, swapping pesticides for homemade garlic treatments.

Titchmarsh will explore how bee hives, homes for insects and deposits from the Royal mews each help cultivate the gardens of Buckingham Palace, with top tips from gardeners giving insight into the Queen¡¯s own tastes.

The programme, to be broadcast by ITV on Christmas Day, will also show how the garden has been used by the royal family for generations, from the king who planted mulberry trees to rival the French to the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret climbing to peer over the high garden walls.

A sandpit used by the royal children will be filmed, along with oak trees planted decades ago by the young Prince of Wales and Princess Royal, grown from acorns sown on the event of their birth.

Titchmarsh, who spent 12 months exploring how the Palace garden changed with the seasons, will be seen finishing the calendar year with a Christmas tree mounted in the Marble Hall, decorated with holly and mistletoe from the royal garden and festooned with festive golden crowns."

530,"A homeless man was given a hundred dollars, and what he did will make you cry. YouTube channel owner Josh Paler Lin decided to see it for himself and capture it all on camera.

Normally when you think of the homeless, you probably picture some drug or alcohol addict who is only taking money from passerby to support their next fix. Some of them even make more money than the average full-time employee working legally just because they¡¯re good actors with bad clothes and not homeless at all.

Instead of assuming the worst, Josh put his money into finding the truth. He started the video asking the audience a question and explaining his idea.

¡°When you give homeless people money, do you ever wonder how they spent it? Today I¡¯m going to give a homeless guy a hundred dollars, and I¡¯m going to follow him and see how he spent it.¡±

Josh approached a homeless man at an intersection holding up one of the usual cardboard signs asking for help, and begins a conversation with the man. As Josh hands the man the hundred dollars, he tears up at the generosity, telling him plainly that nobody¡¯s ever given him that much.

Josh then left the intersection as the camera remained trained on the man. As expected, the first place he went was a liquor store, but if you watch what happens, it¡¯s not what you¡¯re probably thinking. Coming out with a few things in bags, he made his way to the park and started handing food and other items to the homeless people there.

After witnessing this twice, Josh approached the homeless man and told him that what he saw really touched him. He confessed that he had the man followed to see what he would do, and had his doubts initially. The man told Josh that some of the homeless are just people who fell on hard luck, and he told him his story.

To reward the man for his generosity paid forward, Josh gave him another hundred dollars.

Does this change how you think about the homeless?

531,"Nigeria's official news agency says the government fighters from Boko Haram have agreed to an immediate ceasefire.

It quoted the chief of defence staff, Air Marshal Alex Badeh, as ordering his troops to immediately comply with the agreement on Friday.

The news came as another official confirmed there had been direct negotiations this week in neighbouring Chad about the release of more than 200 schoolgirls abducted six months ago. 

Al Jazeera's Haru Mutasa, reporting from Lagos, said details of the deal have yet to emerge.

""""Both sides have agreed there will be no more attacks, no more bombs and no more attacks on Boko Haram.The government will not attack any Boko Haram strongholds for the moment."""" Mutasa said.

""""We do know Boko Haram wanted certain conditions met, for example they wanted their senior commanders released from government captivity."""" Mutasa added.

Abducted schoolgirls

Sources told Al Jazeera that substantial progress had been reached in negotiations about the abducted girls but that no definite deal had been agreed.


Inside Story - Who are Nigeria's Boko Haram?
A senior adviser to Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan told Al Jazeera that the deal reached on Friday included the release of the girls, but that no date had been set and that the release was part of an """"ongoing process"""".

Doyin Okupe said the government had agreed to """"some concessions"""" but did not give any details.

Boko Haram has been demanding the release of detained fighters in exchange for the girls.

The group attracted international condemnation with the April abduction of nearly 300 girls from a boarding school in northeast Chibok town. Dozens escaped but 219 remain missing.

Nigeria's president has been criticised at home and abroad for his slow response to the abducted and for his inability to quell the violence by the group, seen as the biggest security threat to Africa's biggest economy.

Jonathan is expected to announce he will run for a second term in office on Saturday.

532,"YouTuber Josh Paler Lin wanted to see what would happen if he gave $100 to a hungry homeless man. How would he spend the money?

To find out, Josh approached a homeless man by a motorway in Los Angeles, and handed him $100, much to the man's surprise. He then proceeded to follow the homeless man in secret with a camera to see how he would spend it.

What he ended up filming shocked him, and it may just change the way you see homelessness.

The homeless man Josh gave the money to, Thomas, has been very down on his luck lately. He quit his job to spend time taking care of his sick parents. Unfortunately, he lost both of his parents in the last couple of months due to cancer and kidney failure. Additionally, he lost his parents' condo and found himself jobless and homeless on the street. Although he has nothing at this point of life, he still managed to help others when he received something.

Immediatly after releasing this video, Josh was overwhelemd with messages from people wanting to know how they could donate money to Thomas, so the young man set up a campaign on fundraising site IndieGoGo that has already raised over $27,000 in a day.

533,"The heroic sergeant-at-arms who shot dead a lone gunman in Canada's Parliament on Wednesday has been greeted back to work with a lengthy standing ovation.

Kevin Vickers, 58, struggled to contain his emotions as members of the House of Commons paid tribute to his bravery, which put an end to Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's shooting spree.

Rousing footage shows Vickers leading a ceremonial parade into the chamber on Thursday morning and being greeted by enthusiastic applause from the members of Parliament.

He managed to stay mostly expressionless throughout the standing ovation - simply nodding in thanks several times - but as the cheers continued, he appeared to tear up with emotion.

Thankful: After he assumes his position at the end of the chamber, the minutes-long applause continues

After reaching his position at the end of the chambers, he was greeted by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who shook his hand.

Following a minute of silence, Harper embraced Liberal leader Justin Trudeau and Opposition leader Thomas Mulcair and read a statement expressing thanks to the bravery of the security staff.

'We will not be intimidated,' he said, CTV News reported 'We will be vigilant, but we will not run scared. We will be prudent, but we will not panic.

'Here we are, in our seats, in our chamber in the very heart of Canadian democracy, and the work is going on.'

His speech also came just days after a previous terror attack, in which a man with jihadist sympathies ran over two Canadian soldiers in Quebec, killing one.

Following the show of support, Vickers released a statement expressing his gratitude.

'I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday¡¯s events,' he said. 'However, I have the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of Members, employees and visitors to the Hill.'

He went on: 'On behalf of all members of the House of Commons Security Services team, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo. Our prayers are with you.

'Our thoughts are also with Constable Samearn Son, who has been with the House of Commons Security Services for 10 years. Constable Son suffered a gun shot wound to the leg. He is in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.'

Vickers served with the RCMP for 29 years before assuming the role at Parliament eight years ago. The sergeant-at-arms is in charge of security at the House of Commons.

Despite his lengthy service, family members have revealed that Wednesday's attack was the first time Vickers had ever shot anyone.

'For it now to happen at Parliament ... is unbelievable,' his brother John Vickers told CNN. 'We're just relieved he's OK.'

His sister, Mary, added to the Sun News: 'We're always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him - he had to make a very serious decision today.'

'He's always a natural leader. He would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can't stress that enough - but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.'

Determined: Prime Minister Stephen Harper tells the House of Commons that they will not be initimated

Vickers' family gathered at homes in their hometown of Miramichi, New Brunswick to talk about previous shows of leadership.

The National Post explained how Vickers had been dispatched to the Burnt Church wharf 14 years ago when native and non-native fisherman were scrapping. He often visited when he was off-duty ready to listen to the fishermen and helping to resolve their arguments.

'The inspector was a real community man,' Bobby Sylliboy, a longtime band constable with the Burnt Church First Nation, said. 'He was a professional. And for him to use force, it would have had to have been life or death.'

Relatives added that Vickers' constable son, Andrew, is also a selfless leader after he saved a drowning woman three years ago.

After Wednesday's fraught events, MPs hailed Kevin Vickers a hero.

'I am writing this note on behalf of my husband and myself. No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time.

'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created.

'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don't understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don't know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in.

I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer.

We don't wish to be part of any media circus, we don't think it will add anything to the conversation. Please respect our privacy although many may not feel we deserve any ... Once again we are so sorry.'

'MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,' tweeted New Democrat MP Craig Scott on Wednesday.

Matt Miller, the Vancouver Observer's parliamentary bureau chief, concurred.

'Kevin is definitely a hero,' Miller told CNN.

Vickers serves a largely ceremonial role at the House of Commons, carrying a scepter and wearing rich green robes, white gloves and a tall imperial tricorne hat.

A fit, tall 6-foot-4, Vickers spends many of his lunch breaks running in order to stay fit. He also carries a 9mm pistol while at work.

Both things appeared to come in extremely handy while Vickers took down the parliament terrorist Wednesday.

'It's Kevin being Kevin,' his cousin Keith told CBC. 'He's a very intelligent and responsible person. He's a people person-type fellow, too, but you don't want to mess with him.'

He was called into action after Michael Zehaf-Bibeau ran towards the National War Memorial just before 10am on Wednesday and shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a single dad, in the abdomen.

He then ran towards the Parliament and opened fire, shooting dozens of shots as politicians and journalists barricaded doors inside.

Video taken inside Ottawa's House of Commons shows a rush of armed police running toward an unseen suspect.

At the head of the pack is a man - Vickers - moving swiftly with his gun toward Zehaf-Bibeau. Vickers takes aim and fires off multiple shots, killing the gunman.

As shots echo throughout the hall, the video goes wobbly as the men behind their leader Vickers move for cover.

It has since emerged that the gunman - whose full name was Michael, Joseph, Paul, Abdallah Bulgasem Zehaf Bibeau - had recently converted to Islam and had a length history of petty crime.

He had also recently been designated a 'high-risk traveler' by the Canadian government and had his passport seized, according to reports.

On Thursday, his mother Susan Bibeau, who sits on the country's Immigration board, released a statement saying she had been shocked by the shooting spree and, because she had long been estranged from her son, she was unable to shed much light on why he carried out the crime.

She said she felt pain for the victims - not for the loss of her son.

'We are both crying for them,' she told the Associated Press. 'We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created.

'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don't understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don't know, he was lost.'

On Thursday, flags were flown at half-mast across Canada as a shocked and still fearful Ottawa awoke.

Harper and other MPs stopped to lay a wreath at the war memorial - but as the prime minister arrived, police wrestled a man to the ground for getting too close to the leader, CTV reported.

Security remains tight around the Parliament, as politicians and their staff returned to work on Thursday. The grounds, nearby streets and war memorial are still closed to visitors.

537,"Iguala de la Independencia (Mexico) (AFP) - More bodies were being pulled out of a mass grave in southern Mexico Sunday as authorities worked to determine if 43 students who vanished after a police shooting were among the dead.

At least 15 bodies have so far been dug out of pits discovered Saturday on a hill outside the town of Iguala, 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of Mexico City, two police officers at the scene told AFP.

The grim find came a week after the students disappeared when a protest turned deadly. Witnesses in Iguala say municipal police officers whisked several of the students away.

Inaky Blanco, chief prosecutor for the violence-plagued state of Guerrero, declined to say how many bodies were buried in the pits.

""""We still can't talk about an exact number of bodies. We are still working at the site,"""" Blanco told a news conference late Saturday in the state capital, Chilpancingo.

The site was was cordoned off and guarded by scores of troops and police.

More bodies were being recovered on Sunday, another officer said.

Juan Lopez Villanueva, an official from the National Human Rights Commission, said that six pits were found up a steep hill probably inaccessible by car.

Four forensic services vans left for the morgue late Saturday carrying nine bodies in silver bags. Authorities are conducting DNA analysis to identify the victims.

The graves were found after some of the 30 suspects detained in the case told authorities about their location, Blanco said. The detainees include 22 police officers and gang members.

If the bodies are confirmed to be those of the students, it would be one of the worst slaughters that Mexico has witnessed since the drug war intensified in 2006, leaving 80,000 people dead to date.

The students from a teacher training college disappeared last weekend after Iguala police officers shot at buses that the group had seized to return home after holding fundraising activities on September 26. Three students were killed.

Another three people died when police and suspected gang members shot at another bus carrying football players on the outskirts of town.

A survivor said in an interview that the officers took away 30 to 40 students in patrol cars.

Blanco said investigators had confirmed suspicions that a criminal organization, the Guerreros Unidos, was involved in last week's crimes and that local police officers belong to the gang.

Authorities have issue an arrest warrant for Iguala's mayor, who has fled.

In Pueblo Viejo, a hamlet surrounded by forests and mountains, a resident said the region is dominated by a drug gang and that he had seen municipal police officers going up the hill in recent days.

""""They were going up there back and forth,"""" said the resident, Jose Garcia, pointing to a location between two mountains where the graves were found.

- 'Savagely massacred' -

Governor Angel Aguirre appealed for calm in his state, which is mired in poverty, gang violence and social unrest.

""""I call on all (Guerrero state residents) to maintain harmony, non-confrontation, and avoid violence,"""" he said, offering his support to the families of those who were """"savagely massacred.""""

The missing students are from a teacher training college near Chilpancingo known as a hotbed of protests.

Thousands of students and teachers blocked the highway between Chilpancingo and Acapulco for hours on Thursday, demanding help from federal authorities to find the missing.

The police's links to organized crime has raised fears about the fate of the students in a country where drug cartels regularly hide bodies in mass graves.

Around 30 bodies were found in mass graves in Iguala alone this year.

""""We are very worried. The families are very anxious,"""" said Vidulfo Rosales, a human rights lawyer representing relatives of the missing.

The United Nations has called the case """"one of the most terrible events of recent times."""""
538,"On Tuesday, news spread about the reported arrest and interrogation of the wife and son of Islamic State chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Lebanon.

Details about the development are still coming into focus.

The Lebanese newspaper As-Safir noted that the operation was conducted with the involvement of ¡°foreign intelligence.¡± As Reuters reported, Baghdadi is believed to have three wives, """"two Iraqis and one Syrian.""""

By some accounts, the capture of Baghdadi's wife and son provides the Lebanese government with a valuable bargaining chip.
According to a security source quoted in AFP, """"the wife and child were taken to the defense ministry headquarters in Yarze, just outside the capital Beirut, 'where investigations were continuing.'"""" The source added that the arrests had been kept under wraps so that security arrangements could be made.

It's unclear how useful these arrests will ultimately be, but they come as Lebanese authorities attempt to secure the release of 20 soldiers who are currently being held captive by Islamist groups. By some accounts, the capture of Baghdadi's wife and son provides the Lebanese government with a valuable bargaining chip.

This is already proving to be a bad week for ISIS. While the United States and Turkey had been rumored to be close to a deal to coordinate efforts against the Islamic State, on Tuesday, the Iraqi government reached a once-elusive agreement with the Kurds on both oil sharing and military cooperation in the campaign to fight ISIS.

The hoax has gone super-viral and is currently trending all over Facebook, largely because of its ingeniously deceptive presentation.

The hoaxer has included of a thumbnail picture that looks an awful lot like a still from a real TV news broadcast about Culkin¡¯s death. In addition, the hoaxer has chosen a URL that at first glance appears to be MSNBC, the US news network.

Facebook users have shared the link to the hoax story over 700,000 times.

At first glance the story looks credible, although it starts to fall apart when you wonder why the detective involved shares his name with a famous author who wrote books about the New York Police Department.

The hoaxer behind the fake news story has covered the website in adverts, which should be highly profitable.

Despite the flaws in the story, everyone lost their stuff because the headline was already all over the internet.

541,"A South Korean newspaper has reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un underwent surgery to repair fractures in both ankles earlier this month.

The Chosun Ilbo report cited a source who had recently visited the North and claimed that the 31-year-old had undergone the operation at an exclusive hospital for high-ranking Communist Party members in Pyongyang. The source said that he had noticed a marked increase in the number of elite officials visiting the ward and said that bodyguards had been added as extra security.

Kim has not been seen in public since September 3, and his absence has prompted rampant speculation about his health. The whispers grew louder when he failed to attend a regular session of the Supreme People's Assembly last week. The rumors reached a fever pitch Thursday when North Korea's state-run television station showed the man it calls the """"Great Successor"""" limping and admitted that he was feeling unwell, an extraordinary move for the tightly-controlled propaganda unit.

A South Korean intelligence official told the Chosun Ilbo that Kim had initially sprained his ankle over the summer during a tour of military bases and factories and aggravated the injury by not undergoing treatment immediately. Kim has noticeably gained weight since succeeding his father, Kim Jong-il in 2011 and is rumored to be suffering from various ailments, including gout, high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure.

However, the South Korean intelligence official said that an attack of gout would not have been enough to keep him from the Supreme People's Assembly session, lending further credence to the surgery theory. The Chosun Ilbo had reported Monday that a team of doctors from France, Germany, and Russia had recently gone to North Korea.

542,"FEARS have been raised that Islamic State could target Britain with an EBOLA attack after two of the terror group's fighters reportedly contracted the deadly virus.

Sources at a hospital in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul say they have seen suspected cases involving two IS fighters.

They are believed to have unknowingly travelled from their African homelands with Ebola.

The news will spark fears that the jihadists could use the killer virus to hit Britain with so-called """"human-bug bombs"""".

Intelligence experts have already urged authorities to be ready for members of the extremist outfit deliberately trying to spread Ebola in the West.

Even if a calculated plot does not emerge, experts fear Ebola could be accidentally spread by IS ? also known as ISIS and ISIL ? should it tear through the group's ranks.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) was last night scrambling to uncover more information about the Iraqi infection claims.

WHO officials have offered to assist the Iraqi government in investigating any potential outbreak.

However, experts are concerned that the lack of resources and doctors ? caused by IS's bloody campaign in Syria and Iraq ? could make cases impossible to probe and treat.

IS fighters have reportedly killed more than a dozen doctors, who may have been able to confirm the diagnoses, in Mosul.

Meanwhile Western medics, who would normally travel to the Middle East to help, face terrifying risks of kidnap and beheading by IS.

Ebola's potential appearance in Mosul was reported by three separate media outlets yesterday.

Mosul is 250 miles north of Baghdad and has been controlled by IS since June, 2014.

Al-Sabaah, an Iraqi newspaper, said two cases of Ebola and 26 of AIDS were reported in the city.

Citing medical sources, it claimed the virus had been transported from """"terrorists"""" who came """"from several countries"""" in Africa.

WHO director of communications Christy Feig said there has been """"no official notification"""" from the Iraqi government that Ebola has been confirmed.

The organisation is trying to contact Iraqi officials to see if help can provided to investigate any suspected cases in rebel-controlled areas of the country.

Meanwhile a Kurdish official told media outlet Xendan the fighters¡¯ symptoms were similar to those experienced by Ebola sufferers.

However, the effects of Ebola can resemble those caused by a number of illnesses, including malaria and Lassa and Yellow Fever.

They include nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, bleeding and bruising.

Middle East-based intelligence analyst Benjamin Decker said IS's killing of medics and its decision to ban Westerners from its territory could allow Ebola to spread rapidly.

He said: """"United Nations workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria.

""""In this context the lack of medical infrastructure, supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul.""""

Hundreds of Britons are believed to have to travelled to join IS forces, with some already heading home.

Security and intelligence services monitor those who come back to see if they have renounced the terror network¡¯s barbaric regime or whether they remain suspected terrorists plotting UK atrocities.

However, the current system may not equip security services for motoring symptoms of the Ebola, according to the WHO, has killed around 8,000 people in West Africa and affected areas so far.

IS is a hardline jihadist group, which formerly had ties to al-Qaeda.

It seized vest swathes of Iraq and Syria in August in a bid to create a so-called caliphate.

A holidaymaker was left horrified after discovering a tropical spider had burrowed underneath his skin during a trip to Bali.

The 21-year-old Aussie was abroad with friends when he discovered the strange red trail stretching two inches across his stomach.

Dylan Thomas was told by doctors at the Bali International Medical Centre that he was suffering from an allergic reaction to an insect bite and was sent away with some antihistamine cream.

But three days later, when the red mark began to blister, and almost double in length, Dylan knew there was something wrong.

After going back to the medical centre to see a dermatologist, health professionals were shocked to discover that a tropical spider was burrowing just below the surface of his skin.

Doctors managed to extract the spider from Dylan's abdomen and revealed that the insect had buried itself into the scar from his recent appendix removal.

""""It was a bit bigger than the size of a match head,"""" said Dylan about the creature.

And the young holiday maker as now earned himself the new nickname Spider-man.

545,"If you're already using iOS 8's iCloud Drive feature, you might want to avoid your iPhone's """"Reset"""" menu. MacRumors reports that a newly discovered bug causes iCloud Drive documents to be permanently erased from the cloud whenever a a user picks """"Reset All Settings."""" Ordinarily this option would simply do what it says; the iPhone's settings and preferences are immediately reset to their original factory defaults. No media (music, photos, etc.) or documents are supposed to be erased or otherwise affected when performing this action ? that should only happen if you choose """"Erase All Content and Settings"""" and wipe your phone entirely.

But something's clearly not right, with MacRumors reporting that documents stored in iCloud Drive are disappearing from Apple's iWork apps upon reset. They're also vanishing from OS X Yosemite, which will bring iCloud Drive to Mac users later this fall. Right now, it's iOS users along with Yosemite developers and beta testers reporting the problem. iCloud Drive is also available on Windows, but it's unclear if the issue has popped up there. It's also not yet obvious how widespread the bug is or whether it affects everyone that has transitioned to iCloud Drive.

In our own testing, using """"Reset All Settings"""" deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com. After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite, all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well. Preview and TextEdit documents, which cannot be accessed on the iPhone, remained untouched on the Mac.
There's no easy way of recovering documents deleted from iCloud. Apple added a """"recently deleted"""" folder to Photos in iOS 8, but hasn't yet implemented a similar option for all of iCloud. MacRumors notes the issue """"may be limited to Apple's own iWork apps like Pages, Keynote, and Numbers"""" and iCloud Drive files from other third-party apps could be safe from the bug. But for now, the best option is avoiding """"Reset All Settings"""" entirely until a fix is in place. We've reached out to Apple for clarification on just what's going on."
546,"American and British intelligence officials are eyeing a British-born rapper as the militant who beheaded journalist James Foley. 

A senior Western intelligence official told Fox News that 23-year-old London rapper Abdel Majed Abdel Bary is the suspect believed to be Foley's executioner. 

U.S. intelligence officials are not commenting publicly on the reports, but a well-placed source told Fox News that Bary's Egyptian-born father was extradited from London to the United States in 2012 for his alleged connection to Usama bin Laden and the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa.

Bary traveled to Syria last year to fight with  ISIS, the source said. 

The Sunday Times and Sunday People identified Bary as a member of a group of at least three British-born ISIS fighters known among former hostages as """"The Beatles.""""

The Sunday Times reported that MI5 and MI6, Britain's two major intelligence agencies, had identified the man who did the brutal deed, though he had not been publicly identified.

A counterterrorism source told Fox News that the investigation was moving forward and slowly eliminating individuals of interest. The source also told Fox News that the FBI had opened a crisis file shortly after Foley was kidnapped in northern Syria in November 2012 that included signals intelligence and interviews with former hostages. 

The Sunday Mirror, citing British intelligence sources, identified two other suspects as 20-year-old Abu Hussain al-Britani, originally from Birmingham, and 23-year-old Abu Abduallah al-Britani (no known relation), originally from the county of Hampshire on England's south coast. 

The Mail on Sunday reported that the three men known as """"John,"""" """"George,"""" and """"Ringo"""" had formed a special kidnapping gang that may have targeted Westerners like Foley. The paper reported that the hostages regarded the group as particularly vicious jailers, who routinely beat their prisoners and tortured them with Tasers. At one point, the paper reported, the """"Beatles"""" were actually prohibited from guarding the hostages due to the level of violence they inflicted.

According to The Mail on Sunday, the """"Beatles"""" also boasted that they had made millions of dollars from ransoms paid by European countries, enough to """"retire to Kuwait or Qatar,"""" as one hostage told the paper. 

The U.S. and Britain have a policy of not paying ransom to terrorist groups in exchange for captured citizens. However, other Western countries have no such policy. The New York Times reported last month that Al Qaeda and its direct affiliates have received at least $125 million in ransom money since 2008, paid by European countries like France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Austria, and Switzerland. 

Similarly, The Mail on Sunday reported that France had paid approximately $13.2 million for the release of four hostages held by ISIS earlier this year, while Italy had paid close to $5 million for the release of an Italian journalist. The release of seven other European journalists and aid workers reportedly cost a combined $26.5 million. Last week, the CEO of GlobalPost, a media organization where Foley had worked, revealed that ISIS had demanded a ransom of $132 million in exchange for Foley's release. 

In addition to Foley, ISIS is believed to be holding three other Americans hostage. One of them, journalist Steven Sotloff, is threatened with beheading by the militant known as """"John"""" at the end of the video released last week.

The legitimacy of the note, which is noteworthy for its egalitarian tone, has been called into question ? but there's good reason to believe it's real.

A photo of the note was posted to imgur yesterday by redditor fryd_, where it's received a lot of attention. It's also gained purchase on Twitter. As of this posting, this tweet by @henrywarren has been retweeted over three-thousand times:

Counterterrorism police and MI5 believe Bary is the person who appears in the video posted by ISIS, also known as the Islamic State, that shows the beheading of Foley last week.

""""The MI5 investigation into the man behind James Foley's murder is ongoing but they have managed to identify the masked British jihadist who can be seen in the video holding a knife to his throat,"""" the Sunday Times quoted a police source as saying.

Fox News reported that a """"senior Western intelligence official"""" also confirmed that Bary is believed to be Foley's murderer, but U.S. intelligence officials are declining to comment.

Fox News said Bary's father was extradited from Great Britain to the U.S. in 2012 because of his connection with Osama bin Laden and the bombing of the U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa in 1998. A source told Fox that the younger Bary went to Syria in 2013 to fight on the side of ISIS.

The Mirror reported that Bary was performing hip-hop music under the name L Jinny before leaving his parent's home to fight in Syria. Friends of Bary told the Mirror that the performer was radicalized from the teachings of preacher Anjem Choudary.

""""He had the talent,"""" one of his friends told the Mirror. """"He could have been as big as Dizzee Rascal. He was doing music with huge names in the underground scene. People have got into his head. It's transformed a talented young guy into a vengeful extremist.""""

The Mirror reported that Abu Hussain Al-Britani, 20, a computer hacker from Birmingham, and Abu Abdullah al-Britani, 23, from Portsmouth, are also being investigated.

A source told the Mirror that a team of soldiers are on the ground in Iraq and Syria looking to catch Foley's killer within the next few days.

Willie Nelson death hoax spreads on Facebook

Rumors of the guitarist¡¯s alleged demise gained traction on Sunday after a ¡®R.I.P. Willie Nelson¡¯ Facebook page attracted nearly one million of ¡®likes¡¯. Those who read the ¡®About¡¯ page were given a believable account of the American guitarist¡¯s passing:

¡°At about 11 a.m. ET on Sunday (February 22, 2015), our beloved guitarist Willie Nelson passed away. Willie Nelson was born on April 30, 1933 in Abbott. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.¡±
Hundreds of fans immediately started writing their messages of condolence on the Facebook page, expressing their sadness that the talented 81-year-old guitarist and singer was dead. And as usual, Twittersphere was frenzied over the death hoax.

Where as some trusting fans believed the post, others were immediately skeptical of the report, perhaps learning their lesson from the huge amount of fake death reports emerging about celebrities over recent months. Some pointed out that the news had not been carried on any major American network, indicating that it was a fake report, as the death of a guitarist of Willie Nelson's stature would be major news across networks.

A recent poll conducted for the Celebrity Post shows that a large majority (90%) of respondents think those Willie Nelson death rumors are not funny anymore.

On Monday (February 23) the guitarist's reps officially confirmed that Willie Nelson is not dead. ¡°He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. He's still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet,¡± they said.

Some fans have expressed anger at the fake report saying it was reckless, distressing and hurtful to fans of the much loved guitarist. Others say this shows his extreme popularity across the globe.

North Korea dictator Kim Jong-un has undergone a hospital operation after he fractured both ankles.

The 20-stone leader of one of the world¡¯s most impoverished countries has soared on the scales due to his love of fine wine and dining.

Kim, believed to be aged 31, is under armed guard by his personal protection team at a hospital in North Korea¡¯s capital, Pyongyang.

One source in South Korea¡¯s Seoul said there had been a marked increase in elite officials visiting the ward after Kim¡¯s official car did not appear to have left Pyongyang in recent weeks.

Kim is believed to have sprained then fractured his ankles during a gruelling tour of military bases and factories in shoes with Cuban heels to give him a little more height and a physical appearance of more authority.

Painful: Kim Jong-un is believed to insist on wearing Cuban heels for official duty to appear more of an authoritarian

The 31-year-old leader got a taste for Swiss cheese while studying in Switzerland and imports vast quantities despite Western sanctions.

One intelligence source said: ¡°He has become noticeably overweight since he came to power.¡±

Kim was seen limping when he visited a government establishment in a clip shown on North Korea¡¯s Central TV.

There were earlier suggestions Kim¡¯s obesity and binge drinking had brought on gout which confined him behind closed doors for several days.

But aides were determined to turn his health problems to good advantage, with the official Rodong Sinmun daily newspaper saying he had ¡°laboured on¡± by visiting various facilities in the hot summer weather.

Kim even missed a regular session of the Supreme People¡¯s Assembly in Pyongyang last Thursday fuelling belief he was still confined to hospital.

Craving: The North Korean leader's love of cheese has led to rapid weight gain

A Seoul government official said it was unlikely ¡°a young man like Kim Jong-un would have missed the Supreme People¡¯s Assembly just because he has gout.¡±

His absence from the assembly was followed by a rare admission by state TV, which not only showed footage of him limping but also stated that he was ill.

A team of doctors from Europe is also believed to have travelled to North Korea recently.

A political observer said """"coming down closer to the level of his people"""" was the only way Kim was going to return to health, beat his gout, lose weight and prevent a repeat of his reported fractured ankles.

Malnutrition is widespread in North Korea, with famines often breaking out in a country still relying on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s.

It doesn¡¯t entirely matter what the confusion is, so much as people¡¯s willingness to assume the worst, which is precisely what happened to a veteran meteorologist on national television over the weekend. But now, anchor Brian Williams has leapt in to save the day ? he explained that NBC meteorologist Mike Seidel wasn¡¯t peeing in the snow while on-air with Lester Holt, despite how it may have looked, and he called for an apology for the confusion.

Seidel is no stranger to inclement and chaotic weather, as he¡¯s been reporting out of extreme conditions for years. In this case, he was in the thick of a storm in North Carolina when, according to Williams, he lost his cell phone connection to the NBC studio, and thus didn¡¯t realize he was live on-camera. And while he took off his gloves and fiddled with his phone to call them back, turned away from the camera, it painted a very particular picture ? basically, it kinda looked like he was pissing in the snow, and that was all it took for social media to explode.


Social media owes our friend Mike Seidel an apology. The intrepid and fearless Weather Channel meteorologist was the victim of some wild misinformation when this happened on the news here Saturday night. ¡¦ that¡¯s when the rumors hit that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow.
Of course, Williams is well-known to be a good sport with a decent sense of humor, so one hopes his request for an apology for Seidel isn¡¯t too stern. Though really, it wouldn¡¯t much help if it was ? he¡¯s calling for ¡°social media¡± to apologize, after all, so good luck with that. Nor would it have been a big deal if he actually had been, ahem, ¡°writing his name in the snow.¡± Because believe it or not, everybody has to go now and then, even the people on the TV. They¡¯re just like us!


Notwithstanding however, Williams, NBC (and Seidel himself, one assumes) wanted to clear the air about this humble mix-up, and that¡¯s all well and good. Unfortunately, it does steal away basically all the replay value of that misunderstood footage, though. If I wanted to watch somebody struggle to make a phone call with their back to me, I¡¯d¡¦ well, I wouldn¡¯t! Because I don¡¯t want to see that, I just want to see weather reporters sneakily peeing in snow drifts. Is that so much to ask?

The Nigerian government said Friday that it reached a cease-fire agreement with Boko Haram, the jihadist organization that kidnapped 219 girls in April, according to the AFP.

¡°A ceasefire agreement has been concluded between the Federal Government of Nigeria and Boko Haram,¡± said Air Marshal Alex Badeh, Nigeria¡¯s top military officer.

A second Nigerian official told AFP that the ceasefire would include provisions for the release of the kidnapped girls.

¡°They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,¡± said Hassan Tukur, a secretary to President Goodluck Jonathan who served as the government¡¯s representative in talks with Boko Haram.

But some experts questioned the credibility of the officials¡¯ claims, in part because news of the agreement comes as President Jonathan prepares to launch a re-election bid. Announcing the return of the girls, whose abduction inspired the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls, could help Jonathan¡¯s electoral aspirations ? even if the claim turns out not to be entirely true.

The Nigerian government has lied about the girls several times in the past. The government even once claimed to have rescued the girls.

In particular, experts questioned the credibility of Danladi Ahmadu, who the government said was Boko Haram¡¯s representative in the talks.

¡°I have never heard of Ahmadu, and if Boko Haram wanted to declare a ceasefire it would come from the group¡¯s leader Abubakar Shekau,¡± Shehu Sani, a Boko Haram expert who has negotiated with the group before on behalf of the government, told AFP.

And now a new video, coupled with a little bit of investigative Twitter journalism (twournalism), really drives the point home, hard. Recently a unnamed man went on a homophobic rant at the Dallas airport, eventually trying to get violent with the man he was yelling at. As he lashed out, a group of passers by tackled him and pinned him to the ground, restraining him until police could come and handcuff him. And guess what!

Yep, keep an eye out for him in a blue checked shirt and olive-colored jacket, jumping on and holding the dude down. Wonkette has the backstory of how we figured out it was Ant-Man himself.

562,"Investment firm Piper Jaffray issued a report on Monday breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices, saying an aggregate of consumers will likely spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.

Building off Apple's quoted starting price of $349, analyst Gene Munster anticipates combined Apple Watch ASPs to fall closer to $550, or $575 to $600 including additional bands.

Apple Watch will come in three separate price tiers ? Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition ? each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices.

Starting with Apple Watch Sport, the aluminum and glass version widely thought to be the least expensive model, Munster expects an ASP of $450 after factoring in configuration alternatives like case and internal storage options.

The stainless steel Apple Watch model, which also features a more expensive sapphire glass cover, is expected to start at $499 to $549, again depending on customizable features. Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series.

On the high end, the analyst forecasts base model Apple Watch Edition devices to start at $4,999, but classifies segment ASP closer to $7,500 after adding in straps made from precious metals.

Based on current pricing for Apple's silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars.

""""If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,"""" Munster writes.

He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band ? assuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 ? the accessory range would add $25 to Apple's watch category, equating to a $575 ASP. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600.

The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. In an interesting comparison, the firm calculates that Apple Watch Edition business could equate to about two percent of luxury watchmaker Rolex, which moves between 600,000 to 750,000 units each year.

Finally, Munster expects Apple to reveal a better sense of device pricing at its March 9 event, as well as highlight """"special features"""" to drum up consumer interest ahead of release.

AppleInsider will be covering the """"Spring forward"""" event live from San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center next week."
564,"The gunman in a fatal shooting that rocked Ottawa on Wendesday has been identified.

Canadian officials told the AP that the shooter, who killed a soldier and wounded two other people near the Canadian Parliament building, is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau.

Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, was from Quebec and had recently converted to Islam, U.S. sources told Reuters. According to the Globe and Mail, he had been designated a """"high-risk traveler"""" by Canadian officials and was barred from traveling outside the country.

After police chased him inside the Parliament building, Zehaf-Bibeau was killed by Sgt. at Arms Kevin Vickers.

Witnesses told the AP that Zehaf-Bibeau was wearing a scarf over his face when he opened fire in front of the Canadian War Memorial, which is across the street from Parliament.

The Canadian Broadcast Company released an image purported to be of the gunman:

An Ottawa police spokesman told HuffPost that the police were looking for at least one other suspect. However, in a press conference later on Wednesday, officials declined to say if there were multiple possible shooters.

Wednesday's shooting quickly sparked terrorism fears. Just two days earlier, a Quebec man suspected of ties to radical Islam killed one soldier and wounded another with his car before being killed by police. As Reuters pointed out, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, the attacker, was one of 90 people being monitored by Canadian national police over extremist beliefs.

Earlier this month, NBC News reported that the Canadian government was monitoring """"hundreds of people"""" that it suspected could be planning to join ISIS. Anonymous officials told NBC that they were aware of several threats from ISIS supporters, but they said that none were substantial."

In December, the message was lost during a service upgrade, which left the 68-year-old Brit """"absolutely devastated"""" and also """"extremely angry,"""" according to the BBC. So he contacted Virgin Media to see if they could retrieve it and -- with the help of nearly a dozen engineers -- they did.

In the video above, Beaton receives the news that the recording has been recovered. His emotional, teary-eyed reaction couldn't be more heartwarming.

The virus, which has claimed thousands of lives in West Africa, is believed to have been brought to the city by jihadists from several different countries.

WHO spokesman Christy Feig confirmed that the health agency is reaching out to ISIS officials in the region to gather more information, The Daily Mail noted on Friday. Feig said that the Iraqi government hasn't yet responded to the news of possible Ebola cases in the country.

ISIS Executes Nearly 2,000 People in Syria in Six Months

An unconfirmed number of jihadists apparently sought treatment at the hospital in Mosul, which was captured by ISIS earlier this year. Local newspaper al Sabaah has claimed that the virus was brought to Mosul by terrorists arriving from several countries in Africa.

As of the end of 2014, the total death count from the largest Ebola outbreak in history stands at 7,890 people, while over 20,000 have been diagnosed with the disease, for which there is no cure.

The West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been the hardest hit. While the former two have seen the transmission rate go down significantly in the past couple of months, Sierra Leone remains in a fierce battle to contain the virus.

ISIS captured several cities across Iraq and Syria in 2014, and has been seeking to establish an Islamic caliphate in the region.

Confirmation of Ebola cases will likely be difficult, however, as U.N. workers are prohibited from entering militant-controlled areas.

The militants have become known for executing prisoners, including women and children, and giving Christians and other religious minorities an option to convert to Islam, pay a tax or be killed. Over a dozen doctors have reportedly been executed by ISIS in recent weeks for refusing to treat their injured fighters.

The Daily Mail pointed out that there is no information on whether doctors still working in Mosul are trained or equipped to fight a possible Ebola outbreak.

Since Ebola shares symptoms with other diseases including malaria and yellow fever, it is also possible that the cases so far have been misdiagnosed.

It is also not know how many fighters from West African countries could have joined ISIS, though tens of thousands of foreigners and several other jihadist groups have reportedly rallied under the Islamic State banner.

Nigerian terror group Boko Haram also pledged allegiance to ISIS in 2014 ? Nigeria experienced its own scare with Ebola after a number of cases of the virus were reported, but the country was declared Ebola-free by October."

569,"If you needed another reason to hate Comcast, the most hated company in America, they¡¯ve just given it to you: they¡¯ve declared war on Tor Browser.
Reports have surfaced (Via /r/darknetmarkets and another one submitted to us) that Comcast agents have contacted customers using Tor and instructed them to stop using the browser or risk termination of service. A Comcast agent named Jeremy allegedly called Tor an ¡°illegal service.¡± The Comcast agent told its customer that such activity is against usage policies.
The Comcast agent then repeatedly asked the customer to tell him what sites he was accessing on the Tor browser. The customer refused to answer.
The next day the customer called Comcast and spoke to another agent named Kelly who reiterated that Comcast does not want its customers using Tor. The Comcast agent then allegedly told the customer:
Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the internet, are usually doing things that aren¡¯t so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate,   fine, or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules. Do you have any other questions? Thank you for contacting Comcast, have a great day.
How did Comcast know its customers were using Tor in the first place? Because Tor Browser provides online anonymity to its users,  This would mean that Comcast is monitoring the online activities of its users, to (among other things) check if they are following their Acceptable Use Policy.
Comcast has previously been listed by the Tor project as a Bad ISP. The users of the Tor project listed Comcast as a bad ISP that is not friendly to Tor. The Tor project cited Comcast¡¯s Acceptable Use Policy for its residential customers which claims to not allow servers or proxies under ¡°technical restrictions.¡±:
use or run dedicated, stand-alone equipment or servers from the Premises that provide network content or any other services to anyone outside of your Premises local area network (¡°PremisesLAN¡±), also commonly referred to as public services or servers. Examples of prohibited equipment and servers include, but are not limited to, email, web hosting, file sharing, and proxy services and servers;
A Comcast spokesperson told DeepDotWeb that:
We respect customer privacy and security and would only investigate the specifics of a customer¡¯s account with a valid court order. And if we¡¯re asked by a court to provide customer information, then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do, then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away.
However, this statement appears to be at odds with Comcast¡¯s treatment of Ross Ulbricht, alleged Dread Pirate Roberts.
Comcast previously corroborated with the FBI by providing information on alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht¡¯s internet usage. Ulbricht¡¯s legal defense without a warrant. Ulbricht was most certainly never given a warning by Comcast or given time to contact a lawyer before he was arrested in a San Francisco library last October.
Comcast already monitors its customers internet usage to prevent them from downloading pirated media in violation of copyright laws. Under the ¡°Six Strikes¡± plan, Comcast customers who are caught by Comcast pirating copy-written material are emailed by Comcast and told to cease the activity. Comcast will continue monitoring them, and if they violate the ¡°Six Strikes¡± plan five more times, their internet service will be terminated.

570,"You want a gold Apple Watch, you say? Then it's going to cost you... a lot. 

The vanilla variant of Apple's newest wrist-worn wearable device only costs $349. However, if you're willing to spend big cash on something that has the Apple logo on it, the company would be more than willing to accommodate. 

According to analyst John Gruber, the gold version of the upcoming device may cost about as much as the monthly salary of a middle-class worker in the United States. Gruber predicts that the gold Apple Watch would cost $5,000. The figure is basically just a guess. However, it's not an uneducated one. 

""""Most people think I'm joking when I say the gold ones are going to start at $5,000. I couldn't be more serious,"""" Gruber wrote in a blog post. """"The lowest conceivable price I could see for the Edition models is $1,999 -- but the gold alone, just as scrap metal, might in fact be worth more than that.""""

Gruber claims that Apple told him that the gold version of the Apple Watch is made of solid 18-karat gold. It is not gold-plated. This caused him to revise his guess on the price of the device.  

He based his estimate on the going rate for solid gold watches from other manufacturers. Challenging people to find a solid gold watch that costs less than $20,000, he cited a leaked price list for Rolex from 2012. Luxury watch companies don't set prices for their products; they leave that to their authorized dealers. This means that the products on the price list may have ended up being sold for a higher price. In the list, an 18-karat gold Rolex had a price tag of $34,250.


Gruber suspects that the reason Apple has been mostly silent about the specs for the device is that they don't know what the capabilities of the finished product would be. 

""""What does Apple Watch actually do? Or, rather, what does WatchKit allow? We don't know. And Apple is not talking, even off the record. One factor is that the software (and perhaps the hardware internals remain a work in progress). It is far from a finished product,"""" he said. 

Aside from the gold version, Gruber also predicts a stainless steel version of the device that costs $999. It's not clear whether fancier variants of the device would be available with the sport version at launch. Nonetheless, the Apple Watch is expected to ship in early 2015."

572,"As a feel-good video of a generous homeless man continues to touch and move millions around the world, a California man has come forward to claim that the Internet prankster behind it faked a significant portion of the film, confirming our earlier suspicions.

In the video released last week, YouTube star Josh Paler Lin purports to give a homeless man named Thomas $100 and then secretly follow him around to see how he spends it. Thomas walks right into a liquor store. But instead of alcohol, the homeless man defies expectations and walks out with a couple of bags of food, then heads to a nearby park and starts giving it away to other people down on their luck. Apparently moved by the selfless act, Lin confronts Thomas and tells him that he¡¯s being filmed.

Uploaded By: JoshPalerLin

As of Tuesday morning, the video had racked up more than 27 million views on YouTube and inspired more than 150 glowing news articles from around the world. Following its success, Lin launched an Indiegogo fundraising campaign to ¡°help Thomas get a fresh start,¡± which has netted more than $127,000 in well-meaning donations from the public.

But now a nursing student from Anaheim has come forward to say there¡¯s no way Thomas could have been secretly filmed?because he and Lin arrived at the liquor store in the same car. ¡°The whole thing is bullshit,¡± says Taugan Tan Kadalim, who claims that on Dec. 20 he was outside the Euclid Liquor & Market, where the video¡¯s pivotal scene is set. ¡°Thomas knew he was being followed.¡±

The 26-year-old says he stopped at the store to buy a lottery ticket before picking up his girlfriend, who lives in an apartment complex directly across the street. As he was walking out of the liquor store, Kadalim says he spotted Lin sitting in the driver¡¯s seat of a nearby vehicle and recognized him immediately from his previous prank videos. ¡°I was like, ¡®Oh my God, it¡¯s him,¡± says Kadalim, adding that he subscribed to Lin¡¯s YouTube channel. ¡°I couldn¡¯t believe it.¡±

A cameraman sat in the passenger seat of Lin¡¯s car, and behind him was the man who Kadalim would later recognize as Thomas, the homeless Samaritan Lin claims was secretly followed with a hidden camera. Thinking the three men were about shoot a prank video, Kadalim decided to stick around and watch.

What Kadalim says happened next is sure to disappoint many of the millions of viewers who have been touched by the video.

YouTube

According to Kadalim, Lin hopped out of the car, went inside the liquor store and spoke with the cashier. While the two men chatted inside, Thomas waited with his bag by Lin¡¯s car. Eventually, the prankster returned to his car, and a few minutes later, Thomas wandered into the liquor store. Several calls to Euclid Liquor & Market to confirm Kadalim¡¯s account went unanswered.

¡°That was the last thing I remember seeing,¡± Kadalim says.

In the actual video, Thomas appears to be followed from a distance for several blocks, and as he enters the store, Lin says to his cameraman, ¡°Keep filming. Make sure he doesn¡¯t see you.¡±

Kadalim says he immediately fired off a text message about the sighting to his brother, a fellow YouTube prank enthusiast. He shared the text with Vocativ, and the date and time stamps appear to match up. Kadalim¡¯s girlfriend, who spoke on the condition that we not use her name, also corroborates the account.

¡°He told me that he had just run into some famous YouTube star while buying a lotto ticket,¡± she tells Vocativ. ¡°Don couldn¡¯t wait to watch the video.¡±

But when Kadalim did see the video, released on Dec. 22, he was floored.

¡°Bro, he drove Thomas to the liquor store,¡± he says. ¡°While I think the guy is homeless, it is clear that from what I saw every part of that scene was staged.¡±

Upset, Kadalim called his girlfriend and his brother to tell them what happened. As the video started to go viral just before Christmas, he posted a comment to Lin¡¯s YouTube channel explaining what he witnessed. His words, however, were quickly buried beneath an outpouring of praise as thousands left comments in support of the video.

¡°I¡¯m not frustrated because he¡¯s helping a homeless man and people love this video,¡± he says. ¡°I¡¯m frustrated because it¡¯s dishonest and exploitive.¡±

Prior to Kadalim¡¯s revelation, Lin told Vocativ that not a single scene had been staged or scripted. ¡°There is no way we¡¯re making any of this up,¡± he said. ¡°This is real.¡±

Subsequent attempts to reach Lin for further comment on Kadalim¡¯s accusations were unsuccessful.

After the video went viral, Lin told us previously that he plucked Thomas from the homeless shelter where he¡¯d been staying and put him up in a hotel, the name of which Lin would not disclose. Lin has also refused all media requests to speak with Thomas, and he denied repeated requests from Vocativ to make Thomas available for an interview. At the same time, he¡¯s been busy producing more videos starring the homeless man, including this ¡°Xmas Surprise Makeover,¡± released Sunday.

Uploaded By: JoshPalerLin

Lin also informed us that he has at least one more major media event in the works, in which he plans to surprise Thomas with all of the money that¡¯s been raised for him on Indiegogo. Asked how the public could be certain those funds would actually go to Thomas, Lin told us that his lawyers, agent and manager have everything ¡°covered.¡± When asked for the names of his lawyers, agent and manager, Lin refused to provide them, claiming they are ¡°confidential.¡± He also declined to let any of them speak with Vocativ."
573,"Thirty-year-old Dimitry Nikolaev, a married Russian television actor, was having a drink at a bar in Moscow after a theater performance when an attractive, blonde woman approached him. The unidentified woman invited him to accompany her to a sauna where, according to police reports, they drank beer and kissed before he blacked out. 

The next morning, Dimitry woke up at a bus stop to find that his phone, wallet, and testicles had all been stolen. He was rushed to the hospital, where doctors informed him that the procedure must have been done by someone with medical knowledge, as the surgery was done skillfully and his sack was carefully sewn up again following the removal of his nuts. Police therefore believe this was probably a result of organ trafficking, as opposed to a vindictive crime. 

Russian newspaper Life News reports that the actor is having trouble figuring out how to explain the situation to his wife, and for now is simply telling her he is at the hospital for a """"serious illness."""" Though given that the story is all over the media, it's likely she's learned the truth by now."
574,"Apple is reportedly relying on Samsung¡¯s chip-building talents to mass-produce the brand-new chip in the Apple Watch as the device¡¯s launch nears. The S1 system-in-package (SiP) that Apple was mostly secretive about during the smartwatch¡¯s introduction contains various other components on top of Samsung¡¯s chip, including mobile DRAM, NAND flash, and other peripheral chips, with Advanced Semiconductor Engineering providing the SiP modules.

FROM EARLIER: It looks like Samsung is finally developing a worthy rival for the Apple Watch and Moto 360

According to Digitimes¡¯ sources, Samsung has won orders from Apple to make some 3,000 to 4,000 12-inch wafers each month, using its 28nm process technology, with the Apple Watch expected to launch at some point in March.

The Apple Watch is expected to become another important revenue source for Apple, though analysts disagree on the device¡¯s sales performance in its first year. Some expect Apple to sell an impressive number of smartwatches by converting plenty of existing iOS users into first-gen Apple Watch buyers.

Samsung is reportedly making a secret new chip in the Apple WatchSamsung is reportedly making a secret new chip in the Apple Watch

Digitimes says that others have revised downward the number for first-gen Apple Watch shipments to as low as 10 million units for 2015, although they seem to be more optimistic on the device¡¯s second-generation model that will presumably offer stronger battery life and other important improvements."
577,"French Apple website iGen.fr is reporting [Google Translate] that pricing for the stainless steel Apple Watch may start at $500, while the gold Apple Watches' pricing could start between $4,000 and $5,000. iGen.fr has been reliable in the past, most recently reporting the dimensions of both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

While Apple had announced that the Apple Watch would start at $350, which was widely assumed to be the price of the aluminum model, and estimates pegged the price of the gold Apple Watch at prices as low as $1,000 or as high as $5,000, there has been little information regarding the pricing of the stainless steel option.

The site's sources also indicate that Apple still aims to release the Apple Watch by Valentine's Day 2015, which somewhat echoes an earlier report that said the company would be """"lucky"""" to release the device by that timeframe. iGen.fr also mentions that manufacturers and resellers are preparing as if the Watch would release in mid-February 2015. Previously, Apple Senior Vice President of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts said the Watch would release in Spring 2015."

Titled ¡°A Message to America,¡± the video shows the journalist kneeling in a desert landscape, clad in an orange jumpsuit ? an apparent reference to the uniforms worn by prisoners at the American military detention camp in Guant?namo Bay, Cuba. Standing to his left is a masked ISIS fighter, who begins speaking in English, with what sounds like an East London accent. Pulling out a knife, he says that Mr. Foley¡¯s execution is in retaliation for the recent American airstrikes ordered by President Obama against the extremist group in Iraq.

¡°I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers ? the U.S. government ? for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,¡± Mr. Foley says in the video, which was uploaded to the online account of the al-Furqan Media Foundation, according to SITE, an organization that follows jihadist groups. He ends saying that when American soldiers began dropping bombs on Iraq this month, ¡°they signed my death certificate.¡±

On Tuesday night, Mr. Foley¡¯s mother, Diane Foley, issued a statement on the Facebook page the family had created to publicize their son¡¯s disappearance: ¡°We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people. We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.¡±

Two weeks ago, in the wake of American-led airstrikes against the terrorist group, which was fanning out across Iraq, jihadists had taken to social media to call for attacks on American interests. In the three hours after the graphic video of Mr. Foley¡¯s beheading was uploaded on YouTube, jihadists using the hashtag ¡°#NewMessageFromISIStoUS¡± surpassed 2,000 tweets, according to a survey by SITE, with many fighters gloating over his death, and calling it just retribution for the air raids.

Mr. Foley, 40, a freelance journalist who was working for GlobalPost, an online publication based in Boston, as well as for Agence France-Presse, disappeared in Syria on Nov. 22, 2012. He was held alongside several other Americans, whose families have asked for a news blackout.

The video concludes with the fighter threatening to kill Steven Sotloff, another American freelance journalist, who was being held alongside Mr. Foley. Mr. Sotloff is seen kneeling in the same position, in the same landscape and wearing the same style of orange-colored jumpsuit. ¡°The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,¡± the fighter says.

Mr. Obama was briefed about the video by Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, on Air Force One as he returned to Martha¡¯s Vineyard, according to Eric Schultz, the deputy White House press secretary.

In Washington, a National Security Council spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden, said in a statement: ¡°We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist,¡± she said, using an alternative name for ISIS.

Reached by telephone, Philip Balboni, the chief executive and a founder of GlobalPost, said that the newsroom and Mr. Foley¡¯s family were also trying to establish the veracity of the footage. ¡°We are still evaluating the video at this time,¡± he said.

Mr. Foley, who was last seen in Binesh, Syria, was also abducted in Libya in 2011, where he was held for several weeks after running into troops loyal to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi¡¯s crumbling government.

He was among dozens of journalists ? many of them freelancers without the formal backing of a news organization ? who disappeared in 2012 and 2013 in Syria.

It is believed the 32-year-old, who celebrated his birthday last week, is considering building a joint in Scotland, fuelled by the quest for independence north of the border and the communist country¡¯s love of whisky.

¡°The Scottish independence referendum catapulted the country into the North Korean elite¡¯s thoughts.

¡°Despite voting ¡®No¡¯ they¡¯d consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky.¡±

It would be the second North Korean government restaurant to open in Europe after one popped up in Amsterdam in 2012.

The food outlets channel 30% of their takings back to the capital Pyongyang but critics think the cash will be trousered by Kim to fund his own lavish lifestyle.

As well as being hooked on whisky, Kim is addicted to Swiss Emmental cheese, which is partly to blame for his huge weight gain.

It is claimed he imports vast quantities of the fatty treat into North Korea at huge expense despite millions of his countrymen living in abject poverty.

Reports over the last several days had indicated that British intelligence forces were focusing in on the 23-year-old former London resident, who had achieved some fame in the UK for his rap career. Sources say that Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary left his family¡¯s upscale home in London last year to join ISIS.

Bary is believed to have traveled to Syria, and recently tweeted a picture of himself holding a severed head.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary had a somewhat successful rap career, with some of his songs earning play on BBC radio. In early songs he made references to drug use and violence, as well as the threat of his family being deported to Egypt. His father, Adel Abdul Bary, was extradited from Britain to the United States on charges of terrorism in 2012 and was believed to be a close lieutenant of Osama bin Laden.

¡°It¡¯s hard to progress in the future with a damaged past but still I try to count my blessings and I thank Allah,¡± he rapped in 2012.

¡°I¡¯m trying to change my ways but there¡¯s blood on my hands and I can¡¯t change my ways until there¡¯s funds in the bank.

¡°I can¡¯t differentiate the angels from the demons, my heart¡¯s disintegrating. I ain¡¯t got normal feelings.

¡°Even my life¡¯s blessed, still I will not find rest.¡±

In the James Foley beheading video, a masked executioner with a British accent read a statement warning the United States not to enter the conflict. The man later severed Foley¡¯s neck with a knife and cut off is head.

Experts believe that British forces had likely identified Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary not long after the video was released.

Professor Peter Neumann, director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King¡¯s College London, said authorities were likely quite familiar with the British suspect.

He said: ¡°I¡¯d be very surprised if they haven¡¯t already narrowed it down to a small group of people.

¡°The video provides enough clues to show who is responsible. MI6 probably do have a rough idea already of where the hostages are. The intelligence agencies probably have it narrowed down to two or three people.¡±

British intelligence has not officially confirmed that Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary is the suspect in the James Foley beheading."

After several months of limbo after writer Aaron Sorkin finished the screenplay, production on Sony's Steve Jobs movie is picking up. Danny Boyle, who directed Slumdog Millionaire has been announced as the director of the film, and just last week, Sony signed on Christian Bale to play Jobs.

While the previous JOBS movie with Ashton Kutcher focused on Jobs' early life, Sony's film will use material from Walter Isaacson's Steve Jobs biography and will focus on three 30-minute scenes showing three of Apple's product launches.

Update: According to TheWrap, Rogen is not yet officially signed on, while Jessica Chastain is also being considered for an unspecified role in the film."

Does Jess Smith look familiar? If so, it's probably because she's still recognisable as the Teletubbies sun baby - almost 20 years after she starred in the kids' show.

After 19 years, the student has finally broken her silence and outed herself as the the baby face in mega-popular children's TV show.

She was selected to be the giggling baby sun, who looks over Teletubbyland at the age of nine months.

The show was a global hit and Jess, now 19, became one of the most famous faces in the world - but only her family ever knew it was her.

There were even rumours the true identity of the baby was another Jessica Smith - the 27-year-old star of American teen soap Laguna Beach.

But Jess has finally gone public and spoken for the first time about her iconic role in the TV show, which featured characters Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po.

Jess only revealed her secret past during a game with her university friends - where they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.

She then used Facebook to confirm it was her - and photos show she still has the same cheeky face.

Jess said: """"I thought I may as well tell them as I'm going to be spending the next three years with them.

""""My mother is really chuffed.""""

The first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University then made the news public on Facebook.

She wrote: """"So I've recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I've decided it's time to tell everyone.

""""I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I've gained the confidence to come out with it.

""""I am the sun from Teletubbies.

""""There has been quite a few people pretending to be 'the sun' but only I could tell you the real story.""""

Sensation: The Teletubbies gang Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po

Jess added: """"I am really happy, cheerful and giggly. When I told my friends they said they could see me in the sun baby face.""""

Jess' name was put forward when her mother Anji Smith, 44, a recruitment consultant, took her to be weighed at Edenbridge Hospital, Kent.

A health visitor had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies.

Jess was put in a high chair for the filming so she would be looking down like the sun.

Her furniture deliver father Bill, 49, made her giggle by playing with a teddy bear behind the camera.

As no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just ?250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home.

Delighted Mrs Smith said: """"It was just something a bit different to do and we didn't expect it to be as big as it was.

""""They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad.

588,"UK Prime Minister David Cameron denounced the Islamic State (IS) jihadist organisation as ¡°monsters¡± Sunday after the Foreign Office said a video showing the murder of a British aid worker appeared to be authentic.

""""All the signs are that the video is genuine, we have no reason to believe that it's not,"""" a spokesman for the Foreign Office told AFP.

The video showing the beheading of David Haines, who was abducted in Syria last year, was released by IS militants late Saturday. It was the third beheading of a Western hostage by the group in less than a month.

After chairing a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee Sunday, Cameron condemned IS, which has conquered vast swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria in recent months, as the """"embodiment of evil"""" and vowed that the UK would do everything possible to find Haines¡¯s killers.

""""We will hunt down those responsible and bring them to justice, no matter how long it takes,"""" the grim-faced premier said in a televised statement from Downing Street.

He continued: """"Step by step we must drive back, dismantle and ultimately destroy ISIL (IS) and what is stands for. We will do so in a calm, deliberate way but with an iron determination.

""""We will not do so on our own, but by working closely with our allies, not just the United States and in Europe, but with our allies in the region.""""

US President Barack Obama said after the killing that the United States would stand with Britain in an expanded effort against the terror group.

¡°We will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world,¡± he said.

No comment on air strikes

Haines, 44, had been taken hostage in Syria in March 2013 while working for the French NGO ACTED, which was helping thousands of Syrians displaced by the fighting between Syrian President Bashar al-Assad¡¯s forces and rebel groups, including IS, seeking to oust him.

Cameron described 44-year-old Haines as a """"British hero"""", saying that """"his selflessness, his decency, his burning desire to help others has today cost him his life"""".

Those who killed him """"are not Muslims, they are monsters"""", he said.

Cameron repeated his support for US air strikes against IS in Iraq, and for President Obama's strategy to build a broad coalition to fight the jihadists.

But despite growing calls at home for action against IS, Cameron made no commitment to Britain joining the air strikes.

London began sending arms this week to Kurdish fighters battling IS militants in northern Iraq, but it has faced accusations of confusion over its strategy.

During a visit to Berlin this week, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Britain would not take part in strikes against IS in Syria, after parliament last year voted against taking military action in that country.

But just hours later, a spokesman for Cameron's Downing Street office insisted the prime minister was not ruling anything out.

In the footage of Haines¡¯s murder, a hooded militant blames Cameron for joining forces with the United States and says the alliance will drag the British people into """"another bloody and unwinnable war"""".

¡®Barbaric crime must not remain unpunished¡¯

In a statement, ACTED said it was ¡°deeply appalled and horrified¡± by the murder.

¡°David was a new member of the ACTED team supporting the emergency humanitarian response for the displaced Syrian people in Atmeh camp near to the Turkish border,¡± it said.

¡°David was appreciated by the ACTED team and all those around him, notably for his generosity, commitment, and his professionalism.

¡°The horrible assassination of David, an aid worker, goes against all humanitarian principles and is a crime against humanity. This barbaric crime must not remain unpunished.¡±

Before joining ACTED, Haines had also worked for groups such as Handicap International, which helps the disabled during conflicts, and Nonviolent Peaceforce, which sends unarmed peacekeepers into conflict zones. He had previously been in Libya during its civil war and South Sudan.

His brother, Mike Haines, said he had also worked for the United Nations in the Balkans ¡°helping people in real need¡±.

¡°His joy and anticipation for the work he went to do in Syria is for myself and family the most important element of this whole sad affair,¡± Mike Haines said. ¡°He was and is loved by all his family and will be missed terribly.¡±

589,"The reveal of the Apple Watch was unusual for Cupertino, which has traditionally announced products that are ready to launch. We won't be seeing the smarwatch until next year, and Apple is still keeping a few of the details under wraps, including the specs and price.

But one source claims to know what the internals of the smartwatch will be. The word comes from analyst Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company, who quotes a source from Apple's supply chain.

Apparently, the component creators believe the wearable will pack in 512MB of RAM and offer 4GB of RAM as standard, which puts it on an equal footing with the top Android Wear devices out there right now, such as the Samsung Gear 2 and the LG G Watch R.

Arcuri also says that Apple might be offering an 8GB version of the watch as well, though it's unclear whether this information also comes direct from the source - or whether it's speculation on his part.

Juice it up

Finally, Arcuri also says he expects the Apple Watch to feature a wireless chip similar to the one found in the iPhone 5S, which actually included a GPS radio. However, that would contradict Apple, which stated that the Watch will need an iPhone in order to use GPS, so we'd say it's less likely.

Speaking of chips, Chipworks has provided a visual teardown of the Apple Watch internals, and it reckons it's spotted the Broadcom Wi-Fi chip that Cupertino has chosen for its debut wearable.

The important takeaway point is that, if Chipworks is right, the BCM4334 chip used will mean the watch should offer minimal power consumption in the connectivity department.

However, the word right now is that Apple's smartwatch battery will last a day in its current state, so the company might have to look elsewhere in the watch if it wants to insert a little more juicepower before launch.

Apple's watch is still in prototype right now but we don't expect too many of the specs to change before next year. If anything does, we really, really hope it's the battery life."
591,"(CNN) -- Scratch Christian Bale off the list of actors supposed to play Steve Jobs.

Bale was rumored to be the finalist to play the Apple co-founder in the Aaron Sorkin-written film biography but decided he wasn't right for the part, said The Hollywood Reporter.

The Jobs biopic has been in the works since at least 2012, when Sony announced that Sorkin would write a film based on Walter Isaacson's best-selling biography.

Bale is the second notable performer to turn down the Jobs role. Leonardo DiCaprio was also pegged for the film. The Hollywood Reporter noted that neither Bale nor DiCaprio had begun negotiations.

According to Variety, Seth Rogen is being talked about for the part of Steve Wozniak, Jobs' Apple co-founder.

The film is to be directed by Danny Boyle, who won an Oscar for """"Slumdog Millionaire."""" Filming was scheduled to begin this winter."

593,"A PGA Tour golfer said he has sources who tell him that Tiger Woods is currently serving a one-month suspension for PED use. 

Tiger Woods has had a tough career as of late, plagued with injuries and surgeries that have complicated his strong golf swing, and now that he¡¯s taken ¡°a leave of absence¡± until his golf game is ¡°tournament ready,¡± he¡¯s facing criticism.

This criticism blew up Monday morning when professional, but not well-known PGA Tour golfer Dan Olsen went on a radio interview with David ¡°Mad Dog¡± DeMarco on 730 WVFN¡¯s The Game in Lansing, MI and claimed that Tiger Woods is serving a suspension for using PEDs.

¡°I heard he¡¯s on a month suspension,¡± Olsen said. ¡°And it¡¯s kind of a strong witness, a credible person that¡¯s telling me this¡¦ It¡¯s not testosterone, but it¡¯s something else. I think when it is all said and done, he is going to surpass Lance Armstrong with¡¦a¡¦infamy.¡±

WOW. Dan Olsen, who are you?

Olsen¡¯s dislike for Tiger Woods must be really strong if he¡¯s going to go on radio and make wild claims that haven¡¯t been evidenced by anything or anyone else.

As if this wild claim wasn¡¯t enough, Olsen went on to basically say that Tiger is just one big cheater and dragged Rory McIlroy into it.

¡°Tiger, he¡¯s got some problems now,¡± Olsen said. ¡°One of the big problems, Nike¡¯s been giving Tiger a ball that I would almost bet hasn¡¯t been tested¡¦Rory played it too. Remember when Rory signed the Nike deal and he played like an amateur for a year? He was going to fail out of the contract unless he got the high-spin ball too¡¦ So if you go to Tour events, Nike pays them, pays the Tour staff and the range staff, they pay them to get all those balls back. That¡¯s why Tiger would never sign a golf ball and give it away¡¦ He played a ball that nobody else could play.¡±

Again, wow. Dan Olsen is going all in on Tiger Woods, staking his reputation (which obviously isn¡¯t much because most people have never heard of him) to call out Tiger as a cheater.

It¡¯s a tough claim to believe, and one you don¡¯t want to believe, either. Tiger Woods is one of the best golfers to play the game and when he¡¯s done he¡¯ll be remembered as the best.

Tiger has played two PGA Tour events this year and he missed the cut in Phoenix in January and withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open in early February after suffering back pain. Because of his back surgery last summer, I guess it wouldn¡¯t be shocking that Tiger would take PEDs, but IF he even has, they certainly haven¡¯t helped him at all. And Tiger is a veteran, he knows about drug testing and he¡¯s gone through it his whole career.

The claims by Olsen, who has played in 35 PGA Tour events in his career with no top ten finishes, seem farfetched and forced, but you can¡¯t discount them completely. We¡¯ll see if this prompts Tiger Woods or the PGA of America to make a statement denying these facts or coming clean on something that may or may not be true."
595,"Multiple users of anonymous Web browser Tor have reported that Comcast has threatened to cut off their Internet service unless they stop using the legal software. 

According to a report on DeepDotWeb, Comcast customer representatives have branded Tor ¡°illegal¡± and told customers that using it is against the company¡¯s policies.

Tor is a type of Web browser that, in theory, makes all your Internet activity private. The software routes traffic through a series of other connected Internet users, making it difficult for governments and private companies to monitor your Internet usage. Up to 1.2 million people use the browser, which became especially popular after Edward Snowden leaked information showing that the NSA was eavesdropping on ordinary citizens. Prior to that, Tor had been popular among people transacting business on Silk Road, the online market for drugs and hit men.

The problem is that downloading or using Tor itself isn¡¯t illegal. Plenty of people might have legitimate reasons to want to surf the Web in private, without letting others know what they were looking at. But Tor has been pretty popular with criminals.

Comcast has reportedly begun telling users that it is an ¡°illegal service.¡± One Comcast representative, identified only as ¡°Kelly,¡± warned a customer over his use of Tor software, DeepDotWeb reports:

¡°Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the Internet, are usually doing things that aren¡¯t so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate, fine, or suspend your account at any time due to you violating the rules. Do you have any other questions? Thank you for contacting Comcast, have a great day.¡±

Comcast customers, speaking to DeepDotWeb, claimed that Comcast repeatedly asked them which sites they were accessing using Tor.

In a statement to DeepDotWeb, Comcast defended its actions, seemingly asserting that it needs to be able to monitor Internet traffic in case it receives a court order:

¡°We respect customer privacy and security and would only investigate the specifics of a customer¡¯s account with a valid court order. And if we¡¯re asked by a court to provide customer information, then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do, then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away.¡±"

600,"Abuja (AFP) - Nigeria on Friday claimed to have reached a deal with Boko Haram militants on a ceasefire and the release of more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls but doubts immediately surrounded the purported breakthrough.

Chief of Defence Staff Air Marshal Alex Badeh told senior military officials from Nigeria and Cameroon meeting in Abuja that a """"ceasefire agreement"""" had been concluded between the government and the insurgents.

""""I have accordingly directed the service chiefs to ensure immediate compliance with this development,"""" he added.

Badeh's announcement came after a senior aide to President Goodluck Jonathan, Hassan Tukur, told AFP that an agreement to end hostilities had been reached following talks, as well as for the release of 219 girls held captive since April.

But a precedent of previous claims from the government and military about an end to the deadly five-year conflict and the fate of the missing teenagers left many observers urging caution.

Jonathan is also expected to declare his bid for re-election in the coming weeks, with positive news about the hostages and the violence likely to give him a political boost.

Multiple analysts cast doubt over the credibility of a man called Danladi Ahmadu, whom Tukur claimed represented Boko Haram at the two meetings in neighbouring Chad.

""""I have never heard of such a man (Ahmadu) and if Boko Haram wanted to declare a ceasefire it would come from the group's leader Abubakar Shekau,"""" said Shehu Sani, a Boko Haram expert who has negotiated with the group before on behalf of the government.

Ralph Bello-Fadile an advisor to Nigeria's National Security Advisor (NSA), told a conference on Monday that the NSA has been inundated with fraudsters claiming to represent Shekau.

""""Government wants to negotiate,"""" he told a Chatham House event in Abuja, """"but so far nobody has come forward who speaks for Shekau.""""

A screengrab taken on October 2, 2014 from a video released by Boko Haram and obtained by AFP shows  ¡¦
- Chad talks -

Tukur said he represented the government at two meetings with the Islamists in Chad, which were mediated by the country's President Idriss Deby.

""""Boko Haram issued the ceasefire as a result of the discussions we have been having with them,"""" said Tukur, adding that Ahmadu made the announcement on Thursday evening.

""""They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,"""" he continued, referring to the girls seized in northeast Nigeria on April 14, causing global outrage.

Ndjamena refused to comment but security sources in the country said Chad, which Jonathan visited for talks with Deby early last month, had been involved in the discussions.

The source also said a ceasefire agreement was reached as well as the release of 27 hostages, 10 of them Chinese nationals, who were kidnapped in northern Cameroon earlier this year.

The release of the hostages last weekend was """"a first strong signal"""" from Boko Haram to prove their good faith, the source added but did not mention the schoolgirls.

- Discrepancies -

Ahmadu gave an interview broadcast on Friday on the Hausa language service of Voice of America radio in which he claimed to be the group's """"chief security officer"""" and in charge of publicity.

He made no mention of an end to hostilities and was vague on details of the apparent talks, even claiming not to have met Shekau.

He also referred to the jihadi group as Boko Haram, a name that means 'Western education is forbidden' which was imposed on the Islamist radicals by outsiders. The insurgents themselves never use the term.

The group's known leaders have exclusively used the name Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad, which means """"People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet's Teachings and Jihad"""".

He made no reference to the Chibok girls and did not list the creation of an Islamic state in Nigeria's mainly Muslim north -- the core, unwavering Boko Haram demand since the uprising began.

Shekau has in a series of video messages since 2012 ruled out talks with the government and said northern Nigeria will never know peace until sharia (Islamic law) is strictly enforced.

Envoys from Nigeria's presidency have made similar ceasefire claims in the past, notably Jonathan's Minister for Special Duties Taminu Turaki, who led a so-called amnesty commission in 2013 that was tasked with brokering peace.

Turaki on several occasions maintained that he was negotiating with legitimate Boko Haram commanders, including Shekau's immediate deputies, and that a ceasefire was at hand.

But nothing materialised from Turaki's protracted negotiations. Shekau said that he never sent delegates to any talks and attacks continued at a relentless pace."
601,"An explosion and a crater reported near the capital of Nicaragua raised suspicions on Monday that a meteorite had split off from an asteroid that passed by Earth this weekend and struck our planet. But NASA scientists have now cast doubt on whether the blast outside Managua was even a meteorite at all.

The blast left a hole 40 feet (12 meters) wide and 19 feet (5 meters) deep outside the international airport serving Nicaragua's capital. Some Nicaraguan astronomers quoted in early news reports attributed the blast to a chip off a weekend asteroid flyby.

But outside meteorite experts later downplayed links to the small asteroid, dubbed 2014 RC, which passed harmlessly by Earth over the weekend. About the size of a house, 2014 RC passed within 22,000 miles (36,000 kilometers) of our planet on Sunday.

""""Information is limited, but the miss distance of 2014 RC actually precludes any related meteorite impact"""" at the Managua crater, says MIT asteroid expert Richard Binzel, by email.

Managua Meteorite?

Managua residents reported the blast just after midnight. In some news reports, geophysicist Wilfried Strauch of Nicaragua's Institute of Earth Studies attributed the crater to a meteorite impact.

However, NASA asteroid expert Don Yeomans, author of Near-Earth Objects: Finding Them Before They Find Us, says that outside experts suspect the crater wasn't caused by an impact.

""""This event was separated by 13 hours from the close Earth approach of 2014 RC, so the explosion and the asteroid are unrelated,"""" says Yeomans, because the Earth moves about 870,000 miles (1.4 million kilometers) in 13 hours. """"There was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion, so it seems unlikely that the explosion in Nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact.""""

Russian Roulette

Meteorite impacts have occurred at the same time unconnected asteroid flybys in the past, most notably in the February 15, 2013, Chelyabinsk impact, which damaged buildings across central Russia. (See """"Chelyabinsk Meteor: The Animated Movie."""")

That meteorite impact sprang from an object roughly the size of 2014 RC exploding in the atmosphere above Russia, with about 500 kilotons of energy, bright enough to sunburn some watchers. A larger asteroid had passed harmlessly over the Southern Hemisphere on the same date.

Update: In a late Monday report on RC 2014, astronomers at NASA's Near-Earth Object Program based at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, revised size estimates for the asteroid. Radar observations indicate that the asteroid is about 40 feet (12 meters) across and rotates rapidly, several times a minute. That makes it roughly half the size of the 2013 Russian meteorite.

The NASA update also called the meteorite report from Managua """"unrelated"""" to RC 2014, citing the 13-hour difference in the asteroid flyby and the crater explosion. """"As yet, no eyewitness accounts or imagery have come to light of the fireball flash or debris trail that is typically associated with a meteor of the size required to produce such a crater,"""" noted the statement."

The 71-years old priest, identified as, Father John Micheal O¡¯neal, claims he went to heaven and met God, whom he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

¡®Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting, she had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother¡¯s embrace.

The Telegraph reported Tuesday that Woods' former 62-acre island in Lake Malaren, Sweden, has been put on the market. 

The listing agent for Vladi Private Islands says the island, about an hour from Stockholm, features one golf hole in addition to a ¡°mini mansion,¡± secluded villa, hunting lodge, private barber and landing strip for propeller planes. How convenient! 

¡°This island was owned by Tiger Woods,¡± the listing agent said, ¡°but after his divorce he doesn¡¯t need an island in Sweden anymore. This is a unique, exclusive private island with total privacy. ¡¦ 

¡°The protected location, combined with the quay¡¯s generous dimensions, make it an ideal place for private parties and outdoor dining.¡±

607,"If we've learned anything in 2014, it's that teenagers are to be both feared and revered. In a profile published over at New York magazine, one 17-year-old New Yorker confirms that he made $72 million trading stocks during his lunch break at his high school. Someone please send help!!!!

Mohammed Islam is the son of Bengali immigrants who live in Queens. He attends Stuyvesant High School in downtown Manhattan. And now he is richer than all of us by an unfathomable margin. The profile of Islam doesn't seem willing to explain where he got the money to begin investing (there is a mention of earning tutoring money when he was nine) but it does show that teens are just as ridiculous and spunky whether they have a few bucks allowance or $72 million in investments:

Mo, a cherubic senior with a goatee and slight faux-hawk, smiled shyly. """"He's quiet today,"""" said Patrick Trablusi, who was seated with Mo and Damir at a table littered with empty glasses. """"Humble."""" And tired: """"This is our third meeting of the day,"""" Damir said, signaling to the waitress for another round. """"We saw a real-estate agent, a lawyer, you ¡¦""""

""""Next we're going to see a hedge-fund guy,"""" Patrick said. The friends locked eyes and started to giggle.

""""He basically wants to give us $150 million,"""" Mo explained, a blush like a sunset creeping over his cheeks.

The waitress arrived with a tray of green drinks. """"Freshly squeezed apple juice,"""" Damir said, passing them around. """"It's very good. Do you like caviar?""""

New York magazine confirmed that Islam's net worth is in the high eight figures. The teen made his money trading in oil and gold but he won't stop there. Though his parents won't let him move into his rented Manhattan apartment and he can't drive his newly purchased BMW (no driver's license just yet), Islam and his team of three teen Wall Street JV investors plan on starting a hedge fund together in a few months.

As they nobly point out, teens get the money:

""""Money never sleeps!"""" Damir added. """"That's from the Wall Street movie.""""

""""It all comes down to this,"""" Mo continued. """"What makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don't keep going, there's no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.""""

What were you doing as a teenager hey don't answer that.

610,"On Friday, Esquire published an article titled ¡°ESPN Has A Problem With Women¡± that suggests the network was planning to host a male-only panel discussion on domestic violence during this week¡¯s ¡°Monday Night Football¡± broadcast.

The article begins:

On Monday night, a panel on a two-hour pregame show for Monday Night Football will, among other things, address domestic abuse. This panel will discuss, once again, the appropriate penalty for hitting a woman.

The panel for that discussion will include the following people: Chris Berman, Cris Carter, Mike Ditka, Adam Schefter, Tom Jackson, Keyshawn Johnson, Jon Gruden, Mike Tirico, Stuart Scott, Steve Young and Ray Lewis.

Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN. Zero women. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24.

When the show has updates from the field?brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game?they¡¯ll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber.

These people are not allowed at the table.

The assertion that ESPN would host such a panel discussion and not invite any women to participate sparked outrage.

THIS IS HORRIFYING http://t.co/lasYPHtbXl

Utterly speechless. RT @Lahlahlindsey THIS IS HORRIFYING http://t.co/ycDWFvwtfI ¡¦

Chris Berman and Mike Ditka, who are not good at talking about *football,* talking about domestic violence? This has a chance to be A+ TV.

Several other blogs wrote posts questioning why ESPN would only let men participate in this domestic violence discussion. (H/t Deadspin)

ESPN Doesn¡¯t Get It: They Ignore Women¡¯s Voices In Public Dialog About Domestic Violence

ESPN¡¯s Domestic Violence Panel Is Missing Something Important

11 Men and 0 Women on Tonight¡¯s ESPN Domestic Violence Panel

Esquire writer Ben Collins who posted the original article took to Twitter to attempt to clarify what he wrote.

Hi, everybody now reading my ESPN story @Lahlahlindsey's tweet! Note: There's no special panel on tomorrow's Countdown for domestic violence

...Those are the people on the show every week. They haven't changed it in the last few weeks, either. Don't know if that's better or worse.

But there was a top sentence left off that tweet that's going around, and I wanted to clarify. ESPN is mad enough at me as it is. Thank you.

On Monday, ESPN¡¯s John Wildhack, executive vice president of programming and production released a statement refuting Esquire¡¯s original report that the network scheduled any sort of domestic violence panel discussion.

Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight¡¯s Monday Night Countdown. We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting. ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage. Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms, including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more.

ESPN published a blog post highlighting reporting on domestic abuse by its female staffers since the Ray Rice scandal broke last month.

ESPN also posted a list of highlights for tonight¡¯s ¡°Monday Night Football¡± broadcast, which includes no discussion about domestic violence.

ESPN reporter Jane McManus took to Twitter to debunk Esquire¡¯s domestic violence panel story.

ESPN is about to release a statement. I'll go through a few points here. There was never a domestic violence panel planned for MNF tonight.

Since the Rice story broke, ESPN has featured several women prominently, including myself, @katefagan3, @SarahSpain @jemelehill etc.

Tonight's regular MNF panel will be hosted by Suzy Kolber. It was never meant to be a single-issue discussion of domestic violence.

Esquire did not immediately return a request for comment."

Kevin Vickers became the sergeant-at-arms in the House of Commons eight years ago after a varied career in security.

He spent 29 years with the RCMP and rose to the rank of chief superintendent, often serving as the face of the national police force in New Brunswick.

The 58-year-old was appointed director of security operations for the House of Commons in June 2005.

He had previously worked as aide-de-camp for New Brunswick¡¯s lieutenant-governor.

The sergeant-at-arms is responsible for safeguarding the authority of the House of Commons, as well as the safety and security of the Parliament buildings.

As an RCMP officer, Vickers has been responsible for security services provided for the Queen and Prince Andrew.

On Twitter, MPs credited Vickers with saving their lives.

612,"The proposal went off with a different kind of bang than Dim Xiong Chien had expected when his fireworks set the college ablaze

A blundering Romeo who wanted to propose to his girlfriend with a big bang burnt down his college when fireworks he took to mark the event set fire to dry grass.

Dim Xiong Chien, 22, had taken three large boxes of fireworks onto campus where he planned to set them off as he got down on one knee and popped the question to girlfriend Cong Yen, 22.

But when she forgot to turn up he set them off anyway hoping she would see them and go and see what was happening.

When Chien's girlfriend did not turn up he lit the fireworks anyway, hoping she would see them and come to see what was happening

Pal Shin Tan, 21, said: """"He had prepared this big event in secret and had told her to meet him by the sports ground for a romantic walk.

""""She had no idea he was planning to propose though, and clearly forgot all about the walk.""""

As firemen rushed to the scene to put out the three-metre high flames on the grass, gutted Chien went looking for forgetful Yen.

He said: """"I was feeling a bit surprised that she hadn¡¯t shown up, and was completely unaware that the fireworks had set the grass on fire.

""""When I found her I said she had to come with me as there was something important I wanted to tell her and show her.

""""But as we approached the sports hall we saw all these flames and firemen and I decided to postpone the proposal to another date.""""

""""Of course, I love him, but my parents have told me to steer clear, saying he can¡¯t even ask me to marry him without causing a massive hoo-ha.""""

It took firemen over an hour to extinguish the blaze at the Liaoning Advertisement Vocational College in the city of Shenyang in north-eastern China's Liaoning province.

A college spokesman said: """"The hall is covered by insurance and we have yet to make a decision about how to punish this student."""""
614,"Batman as Steve Jobs? Sure. How about that guy from Superbad as Woz, too?
Seth Rogen has reportedly signed on to star as Steve Wozniak in the upcoming Steve Jobs film from Sony. You know, the as-yet-untitled biopic written by Aaron Sorkin, creator of """"The Newsroom"""" and """"The West Wing.""""
The comic actor would join Christian Bale, who is tipped to play Jobs, according to Variety.
Sony's flick would be the fourth such feature film that's either in the works or has already been made about Jobs, sharing the marquee with 2013's """"Jobs"""" (the one with Ashton Kutcher), """"iSteve"""" from the same year (the one made by Funny or Die), and 1999's """"Pirates of Silicon Valley"""" (the one where the iPhone hadn't been invented yet). One might argue that the world is a bit Jobs'd out, but we suppose it depends on the strength of Sorkin's script and Danny Boyle's directing.
On the plus side, the film is based on Walter Isaacson's biography of the late Apple CEO?titled simply, """"Steve Jobs""""?which was Amazon's best-selling book for 2011.
If you ask Sorkin, though, the movie isn't entirely biographical per se.
""""It's not a biopic; it's not the story of Steve Jobs?it's something much different than that. He's a fascinating guy?part hero, part antihero,"""" Sorkin said earlier this year, as reported by Mashable.
""""I don't want to make any news or make anyone feel like I approached the movie in a different way. I'm going to make the movie speak for itself. But he's a fascinating guy surrounded by fascinating people, and he had very interesting relationships with the people in his life,"""" Sorkin said in a separate interview.
Rogen isn't officially on board just yet, per The Hollywood Reporter, and it's unknown whether an official offer has been made or even if any kind of negotiations have taken place. Bale is supposed to be in the midst of negotiations to appear as Jobs.
Leonardo DiCaprio was first tapped for the role of Jobs, but dropped out earlier this month to take a role in """"The Revenant."""" After that, DiCaprio plans to take a long break from acting, according to The Hollywood Reporter."

616,"Breaking news on Sunday morning reports that senior western intelligence officials confirm that the London rapper is the major suspect in the beheading of James Foley. The London rapper, Abdel Majed Abdel Bary, is the 23-year-old man believed to have beheaded Foley on the video that was seen worldwide last week, according to Fox News on Aug. 24.

Bary, who was big into the London rap scene was heard on the BBC radio with his music, but he left London last year to go to Syria and fight with the ISIS. Bary is identified as one of the group that consists of at least three British-born ISIS fighter, dubbed ¡°The Beatles.¡±

The Israel Times reports today that Bary¡¯s songs were featured on BBC radio in the past, as he was at one time a popular rapper going by the name Jinn Matic. Those recordings of his songs that once played on the radio are a treasure trove of data used by the investigators today.

Britain used high tech voice recognition to identify ¡°Jihadi John,¡± the man seen in the video with Foley, reports the Telegraph. Bary¡¯s recording music has been of vital importance when using the high-tech equipment to identify the voice on the video. His songs like Dreamer, Flying High and Overdose were hits on the popular BBC radio, but they are important pieces of evidence today, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

While news that Bary was suspected to be the man seen on the video beheading Foley hit early this weekend. On Sunday morning it is confirmed that he is the main suspect and not just one of many.

Dressed all in black with a mask covering his face, the executioner beheaded James Foley, an American journalist, on a video that was later posted on YouTube by ISIS. Barry was seen early this month on YouTube holding the severed head of one of his victims, so there¡¯s no question about him being very capable of what many see as pure evil.

The World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health in Iraq made that clear in a statement late Monday, saying there are no suspected infections from the deadly virus in the country. That came after rumors spread online and through several media outlets on Dec. 31. Most of them cited anonymous medical sources in the city of Mosul, which has been under the control of Islamic State militants since June.

The virus spreading through Iraq would have raised concerns for both the local population and American troops who recently began training the Iraqi military. According to the discredited reports, the virus was said to have been brought to Iraq by militants and other migrants coming to the country from Africa.

Health officials said that simply isn¡¯t true. The Ministry of Health and World Health Organization investigated the reports through surveillance networks and contacts with medical sources in Mosul, and found that there were no cases of the virus.

¡°The Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization further confirmed that the laboratory facilities in Mosul do not have the necessary capabilities to diagnose and confirm the Ebola Virus,¡± according to the joint statement?a question that was raised by skeptics when the rumors spread last week.

Apparently, his desire for secrecy does not apply in this case, as he openly expressed his frustration about the Episode VII leaks.

Next to that lot, deep fried Mars bars and a national dish made from sheep¡¯s bowels sounds positively delicious.

Kim is alleged to be eyeing up Scotland because of his love of whisky ? which is so popular in his communist dictatorship it¡¯s sometimes used instead of money.

The company's CEO and co-founder, Philip Balboni, says GlobalPost had been working to learn who kidnapped Foley, and where he was being held captive.

""""Although GlobalPost's investigation at one point led us to believe that James was being held by the Syrian government, we later were given strong reason to believe he was being held by Islamic militants in Syria,"""" Balboni said. """"We withheld this information at the request of the family and on the advice of authorities cooperating in the effort to protect Jim. GlobalPost, working with a private security company, has amassed an enormous amount of information that has not been made public.""""

Foley was on a freelance assignment for GlobalPost when he was abducted in northern Syria on Nov. 22, 2012. He had been making his way to the Turkish border when he was stopped by a group of armed men, the organization says.

Back in 2011, Foley was one of three journalists who were held captive for more than a month after being attacked by Gaddafi fighters near Benghazi. A fourth journalist didn't survive the attack.

Their ordeal led Foley and one of his colleagues, American Claire Gillis, to visit NPR's Talk of the Nation back in 2011. Discussing the uncertain weeks of their captivity, Foley said they """"turned to a lot of prayer"""" and exercise. In the end, he was the last of the journalists to be released, after spending a week as the sole Westerner in the prison.

""""I started to have some dark thoughts,"""" he said. """"I started to think, you know, maybe they're keeping the American guy as the ace in the hole... I thought maybe I was going to be a bargaining chip."""""
633,"Knightscope co-founder Stacy Stephens said rumors that its K5 security robots are roaming Microsoft's Silicon Valley campus are not true.

Sorry to rain on the rumor mill's parade, but RoboCop-style robots are not patrolling Microsoft's Silicon Valley campus.

The rumor took shape after California-based Knightscope showed off its K5 security robot at an event hosted at Microsoft, according to Knightscope co-founder and Vice President Stacy Stephens.

""""So people started snapping photos,"""" and all the sudden a number of news outlets were reporting the robots had been deployed at Microsoft's offices in Mountain View, Calif., Stephens said.

The 5-feet, 300-pound K5 looks like R2-D2 from Star Wars. They roam around with a slew of sensors, looking for trouble, sounding alarms and alerting live security guards.

Knighscope has built the security-guard-mimicking robot and it is trying out the technology with an undisclosed number of partners ? but Microsoft is not one of those testers.

""""Obviously we're right across the street so we would love them to be [a customer],"""" Stephens said. """"But we have not deployed there.""""

Stephens said he got a phone call from Microsoft this morning after the news broke.

""""They said, 'Hey, this is really cool. We didn't know we were doing this.' I said, 'You're not,'"""" Stephens said.

""""Unfortunately, that's what people get for not calling us up to confirm things,"""" he added.

So, sorry Microsoft employees. It looks like no robots will be watching over your car in the parking lot ? for now."

636,"Eleven Iraqi police officers were taken to hospital after an ISIS chemical weapons attack, with the Defense Ministry and doctors recently confirming the gas as chlorine. This marks the first officially documented militant attack with the chemical.

The Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) militants¡¯ chlorine gas attack occurred on September 15, in the town of Duluiyah, located north of the capital, according to a Washington Post report.

The blast followed an exchange of fire between the militants and the members of the Sunni Jabbour tribe, who were guarding the town¡¯s borders.

¡°It was a strange explosion. We saw yellow smoke in the sky,¡± said Lt. Khairalla al-Jabbouri, one of the survivors.

The victims talked of the fog that hung close to the ground ? a possible indication that it was chlorine, which is heavier than air.

The physicians who treated them also confirmed that their diagnosis was poisoning by chlorine gas.

¡°They were panicked; we were panicked,¡± said Kasim Hatim, director of the hospital in the nearby city of Balad, where the officers were taken. ¡°We initially thought it might be a more serious gas, a nerve gas or an organophosphate.¡±

Image from Google MapsImage from Google Maps

A recent statement from the Iraqi Defense Ministry said that the IS had used the gas in a ¡°primitive and ineffective way¡± ? in roadside bomb attacks and near several water treatment plants where it had gained access to chlorine. Without indicating the locations of the attacks, the statement said that the militants aimed at impairing ¡°the morale of the Iraqi people in general and our armed forces in particular.¡±

American defense officials were not aware of the September 15 chlorine attack and referred to the Iraqi government for further information.

Alistair Baskey, spokesman for the National Security Council, told the New York Times on Thursday, ¡°The use of chlorine as a chemical weapon is an abhorrent act. These recent allegations underscore the importance of our work to eliminate chemical weapons in this volatile region.¡±

There have lately been several reports of IS militants using chlorine gas on the battlefield, however, none had been officially confirmed. They appeared after the jihadists seized a large former Iraqi chemical weapons production plant this summer, whose 2,500 degraded rockets the Iraqi officials claimed unlikely to be fit for use.

Earlier this week, reports were circulating that there was a chemical attack in the besieged Syrian town of Kobani on Tuesday. But the chemical agent the IS militants used couldn¡¯t be identified, as doctors lacked necessary equipment to diagnose the cause of complaints made by Kurdish victims and activists.

As a choking agent, chlorine was widely used during World War I. Nowadays it is sold legally as a key component in industry, but its use as a chemical weapon violates the Chemical Weapons Convention."
638,"Claim: The town of Purdon, Texas was quarantined after a family of five there tested positive for the Ebola virus.

FALSE

Example: [Collected via email, October 2014]

News report of family of 5 in Purdon, Texas tested positive for Ebola. Town is quarantined.

Origins: On 14 October 2014, the National Report published an article claiming that the town of Purdon, Texas, had been quarantined after a local family of five tested positive for Ebola. Purdon is located 70 miles from Dallas, the city in which Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan died of the disease. Shortly after Duncan's death, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) disclosed that a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital had contracted the hemorrhagic virus while caring for Duncan.

The National Report article referenced both the death of Duncan and the illness of nurse Nina Pham as context for the claim about a quarantine in Purdon:"
639,"The World Health Organization is looking into reports that ISIS fighters in Iraq have been showing up at hospitals with Ebola symptoms.

According to the pro-government Iraqi newspaper al Sabaah, an unknown number of ISIS militants have shown up at a hospital in the militant-controlled city of Mosul, about 250 miles north of Baghdad. The paper reported that foreign terrorists brought the disease into Mosul from ¡°several countries¡± in Africa. (RELATED: ISIS Massacred Every Man And Boy Over 15 In Muslim Town)

It¡¯s not yet clear whether the ISIS extremists actually have Ebola or another disease. Ebola symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea and unexplained bleeding and bruising ? problems which could also be attributed to malaria or yellow fever. And doctors in Mosul might be unable to even test for Ebola.

WHO spokeswoman Christy Feig said the organization is reaching out to officials in the ISIS-held area to offer help if the disease does turn out to be Ebola. However, United Nations workers are not allowed to work in ISIS-controlled areas in either Iraq or Syria, so a UN operation to help either ISIS militants or any civilians in the areas who contract Ebola is unlikely.

Feig told Mashable that there¡¯s been no official notification from the Iraqi government that the terrorists¡¯ disease is, in fact, Ebola.

ISIS is against western science and medicine as a rule, but apparently several militants have taken to hospitals with Ebola-like symptoms anyway. Since taking control of Mosul in June 2014, ISIS has taken to executing doctors that refuse to treat them.

Kurdish news website Rudaw reported in Nov. 2014 that ISIS executed six doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat wounded fighters, in addition to kidnapping six merchants for failing to pay a monthly tax to ISIS. The group reportedly executed two more doctors just last week.

The U.S. has been hitting ISIS with air strikes since mid-November and the Pentagon confirmed in December that the strikes have killed around 1,000 fighters, including three senior ISIS officials.

An Ebola outbreak, however unlikely, probably wouldn¡¯t help matters much.

640,"Jordan's King Abdullah, a trained pilot, could lead revenge airstrikes on Islamic State himself, it has been revealed.

The monarch may personally take part in bombing raids on extremist strongholds on Thursday, according to reports in Arabic-language newspapers.

It comes after the former general told members of Congress that he was ready to exact a blistering revenge against the ISIS terror army for the brutal execution of military pilot Moaz al-Kassasbeh - and he quoted a Clint Eastwood movie character to make his point.

Jordan's King Abdullah (pictured), a trained pilot, could lead revenge airstrikes on Islamic State himself, it has been revealed

Uncompromising language; King Abdullah of Jordan, (center), is hurried into a meeting with leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the Capitol in Washington after shocking footage of a Jordanian pilot being burned alive was released online Tuesday

According to the dailycaller, reports have emerged suggesting he could take part in airstrikes on ISIS targets today.

California Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter told the Washington Examiner that the king quoted the scene where Eastwood's character announces his plan for retribution.

'Any man I see out there, I'm gonna kill him,' Eastwood's William Munny says in 'Unforgiven.'

'Any son of a bitch takes a shot at me, I'm not only going to kill him, I'm going to kill his wife and all his friends and burn his damn house down.'

'He said there is going to be retribution like ISIS hasn't seen,' Hunter said. 'He's angry. 'They're starting more sorties tomorrow than they've ever had. They're starting tomorrow. And he said, """"The only problem we're going to have is running out of fuel and bullets"""".'

'He's ready to get it on. He really is. It reminded me of how we were after 9/11. We were ready to give it to them.'

Last-minute meeting: Jordan's King Abdullah II (left) met with President Obama at the White House on Tuesday after video emerged showing the brutal execution of one of his country's pilots by the ISIS terrorist group

Brutal: Footage titled 'Healing the Believers Chests' appears to show captured airman Moaz al-Kassasbeh wearing an orange jumpsuit as a trail of petrol leading up to the cage is set alight

Hunter told the Examiner that no one in the king's meeting on Tuesday with members of the House Armed Services Committee made any mention of President Obama, who is seen by some anti-ISIS coalition partners as a weak and indecisive actor.

South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said after a separate meeting with the king that Jordan would have a 'strong and forceful' response to the the fiery execution.

'The Jordanian response will be more engaged, not less engaged, when it comes to destroying ISIL,' Graham said.

'The king feels that the gloves are off and that it now is time if you can't negotiate with these people, you're going to have to take it to them, and I think it's going to be more than Jordan.'

Obama and Abdullah met Tuesday evening in a hastily arranged meeting just hours after a grisly video emerged showing al-Kassasbeh, who was 26 years old, being burned alive in a cage by ISIS.

They emerged from the meeting, vowing to continue their fight of the extremist group gaining control over large swathes of Iraq and Syria.

In addition, the State Department said Tuesday that the administration will increase its annual aid to Jordan to $1 billion from $660 million to help it pay for the cost of housing refugees from Iraq and Syria ? and provide new resources to fight ISIS.

An agreement on the aid will require congressional approval.

In a brief statement, the U.S. State Department said it planned to provide $1 billion per year to Jordan for each of the U.S. fiscal years for 2015, 2016 and 2017. The U.S. fiscal year ends on Sept. 30.

Captured: Muath al-Kasasbeh (centre in white) was captured by the Islamic State after after crashing near its HQ in the Syrian city of Raqqa in December. ISIS is now believed to brutally murdered him

Al-Kassasbeh was captured in December when his F-16 jet crashed over northern Syria, a mission that was part of the U.S.-led coalition campaign against the jihadists.

During the meeting, President Obama offered 'his deepest condolences' to the king over the pilot's death

'The president and King Abdullah reaffirmed that the vile murder of this brave Jordanian will only serve to steel the international community's resolve to destroy ISIL,' said White House spokesman Alistair Baskey.

Obama earlier decried the 'cowardice and depravity' of the Islamic State, saying the brutal killing would only strengthen international resolve to destroy the extremists.

The White House would not speculate on whether the video was released to coincide with Abdullah's visit to Washington, where he was not scheduled to meet Obama.

The president said First Lieutenant Kassasbeh's 'dedication, courage and service to his country' represented 'universal human values that stand in opposition to the cowardice and depravity of ISIL.'

'Today, we join the people of Jordan in grieving the loss of one of their own,' the president added, as his administration reaffirmed its intention to give Jordan $3 billion in security aid over the next three years.

'As we grieve together, we must stand united, respectful of his sacrifice to defeat this scourge,' Obama said after the latest in a wave of grizzly filmed murders.

Jordanian state television said that Kassasbeh was killed on January 3.

The slaying would redouble international commitment to ensure the Islamic State group 'are degraded and ultimately defeated,' said Obama.

The extremists seized swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria last year, declaring an Islamic 'caliphate' and committing a wave of atrocities.

Countries as diverse as the United States, Saudi Arabia and Jordan responded with 'Operation Inherent Resolve,' an air-led campaign to pummel the jihadist group.

US Central Command meanwhile admitted that the Islamic State still had the ability 'to conduct small-scale operations,' despite months of air strikes.

But, it said, 'their capacity to do so is degraded and their momentum is stalling.'

Attacks have hit the group's 'ability to command and control forces; recruit, train and retain fighters, produce revenue from oil sales, and maintain morale.'

Islamic State had offered to spare Kassasbeh's life and free a Japanese journalist in return for the release of a female would-be suicide bomber on death row in Jordan.

Jordanian officials announced the female bomber and other jihadists would be executed on Wednesday."
643,"When Apple unveiled the Apple Watch, the unveiled three different editions: the Apple Watch, the Apple Watch Sport, and the Apple Watch Edition. The latter model appears to be catered to those who are more interested in fashion and luxury as the watch will be given an 18-karat gold treatment.
Sure, we guess it looks good but at the same time, have you ever wondered how much it will cost? Apple has declined to state a price of the Apple Watch Edition but according to the folks at TechCrunch, it is possible that the gold Apple Watch could retail for as much as $1,200. This is according Chad Rickicki, a watch expert who claims that the 18-karat gold Apple Watch would cost $600 just for the case, size, and shape alone, and that combine it with the electronics and markup, could end up being in the $1,200 range.
This is a significant leap over the base Apple Watch which Apple has said would be priced starting at $349, so safe to say it is an interesting direction that Apple is headed if they do indeed price the Edition at over $1,000. Given how Apple¡¯s recent hires have come from the high-end fashion industry, we can¡¯t say this is too surprising.
In fact a rumor earlier this year had even suggested that Apple could be preparing an Apple Watch that could cost thousands, thus making these claims slightly more believable. Either way we expect Apple will announce the prices in the near future as the Apple Watch has currently been pegged for a release in 2015."
645,"The Apple Watch will not be an accessory for your iPhone - but your iPhone will be an accessory for your Apple Watch, claims technology writer John Gruber, who expects the new wearable to cost upwards of $10,000 (?6,500/¢æ8,800). Due to go on sale in April, the Apple Watch will start at $349 for the basic Sport model with a rubber strap, but beyond that no one knows how much the stainless steel and 18-karat gold Edition models will cost. A debate between technology and wristwatch experts is under way to determine how far into uncharted water Apple is willing to sail. First, Stephen Foskett of Grail Watch chimed in, suggesting (although using self-proclaimed """"back of envelope"""" maths) the gold Apple Watch Edition will cost at least $10,000, based on the materials used. Foskett points to the huge gap in prices between stainless steel and gold versions of Swiss watches of a similar size and shape to the Apple Watch, noting how the Cartier Tank - a watch praised by Apple design chief Jony Ive - costs $7,000 in steel and $22,000 in pink gold. The Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime, slightly larger than the 42mm Apple Watch, costs $8,550 in steel and $23,000 in gold - and a gold strap is a further $20,000. Apple must also price the Watch so it is protected against the volatility of gold. Foskett said: """"[Watchmakers] can't price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labour, distribution and profit in a watch."""" Will the Apple Watch be gold plated to save costs? Apple Watch will go on sale before the end of April(Apple) Foskett says not. Although Apple doesn't describe the Watch Edition as being """"solid gold,"""" it does say it is """"crafted from 18-karat gold,"""" and nowhere is the material described as plated or gold filled. Entering the jewellery market means complying with new regulation, Foskett explains. """"There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could."""" Add to this Apple's claims of producing the Watch from gold twice as hard as standard gold, and it is clear that the company will not be scrimping on materials. Foskett believes $9,999 for the 42mm model and $7,999 for the 38mm version of the gold Watch Edition could well be possible. Days later, Apple commentator John Gruber blogged to say he also thinks the price will be $10,000. """"The more I think about it, and the more I learn about the watch industry, the world of luxury goods, and the booming upper class of China, the better I feel about that bet. I don't think I was wrong to place a friendly late night bar bet on a $9,999 starting price [for the gold model]."""" Gold straps Gruber says a """"starting price"""" because he expects Apple to announce a new gold band when the Watch finally gets a price and release date - and for this he suspects the company will charge an additional $10,000. Looking at how Rolex charges a much higher premium for its gold models over steel - and for watches with identical movements - Gruber says the Apple Watch Edition """"is not a tech product, so don't try to price it like one... Apple's ambitions in this arena, I am convinced, are almost boundless."""" Buying the Watch Edition will be unlike buying any other product in Apple's history. Reports claim the company will store the watches in safes, and that it is even considering completely separate boutique stores to sell them. Apple is expected to reveal the Watch's pricing structure and release date at a media event before the end of April 2014.

649,"A student has broken a 19-year silence and revealed she was the iconic sun baby in hit TV show Teletubbies.

Jess Smith, from Chatham, Kent, was selected to be the giggling baby sun who looks over Teletubbyland when she was just nine months old.

The show was a global hit and Miss Smith, a first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University, became one of the most famous faces in the world - but only her family knew it was her.

Jess Smith (pictured left and right as a baby) was chosen as the giggling baby sun who looks over Teletubbyland when she was just nine months old - but kept her role a secret for 19 years

There were rumours the true identity of the baby was another Jessica Smith - the 27-year-old star of American teen soap Laguna Beach.

But Miss Smith has finally gone public and spoken for the first time about her role in the TV show which featured characters Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po.

Miss Smith only revealed her secret during a game with her university friends - where they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.

She then used Facebook to confirm it was her - and photos show she still has the same cheeky face.

Miss Smith said: 'I thought I may as well tell them as I'm going to be spending the next three years with them. My mother is really chuffed.'

Miss Smith revealed her secret during a game with her university friends where they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess - she is pictured left and right as the smiling sun baby

She then made the news public on Facebook.

She wrote: 'So I've recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I've decided it's time to tell everyone.

'I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I've gained the confidence to come out with it.

'I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be 'the sun' but only I could tell you the real story.'

Miss Smith is now a first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University

Miss Smith added: 'Everyone says they can see the likeness between my face now and me as a baby. I still have a baby face. I haven't changed much either. I am still giggly.'

Miss Smith posted a picture of a letter her parents received from Courtyard Productions in Four Elms, Kent, on June 17, 1996, on Facebook proving she was the baby - not the American TV star Jessica Smith.

She said: 'I'm not sure why the actress is claiming to be the face or why people think she is.

'She would have been 10 at the time of filming - and she doesn't even look like the baby.

'My neighbours said I should put everyone right as they would be annoyed if it was them. But I wasn't that bothered until I told my uni friends.

'I am not sure why they picked me - I assume because I was more giggly than everyone else.'

She added: 'I do remember watching the Teletubbies when I was a child.

'When I was young I used to laugh along with the sun but it was only when I got older that I understood it was me.

'My close friends and family knew, but it just never interested me before to tell everyone.

'At uni we had to tell the person sitting next to us something about ourselves so I thought I would say it.

'Then people from uni convinced me to tell everyone and they encouraged me through it all.

'I am proud. I wouldn't change it for anything.

'My family will all remember it for ever. My nan has articles about me when I was baby all over her wall.'

As no one could predict the success of Teletubbies (pictured) Jess was paid ?250 and given a box of toys

Her name was put forward when her mother Anji Smith, 44, a recruitment consultant, took her to be weighed at Edenbridge Hospital, Kent.

A health visitor had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies.

Miss Smith was put in a high chair for the filming so she would be looking down like the sun.

Her father Bill, 49, made her giggle by playing with a teddy bear behind the camera.

As no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just ?250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home.

Delighted Mrs Smith said: 'It was just something a bit different to do and we didn't expect it to be as big as it was.

Miss Smith (pictured left) with a friend, said she is not disappointed by her small payment of ?250

'They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad.'

Miss Smith said she is not disappointed by her small payment of ?250.

The production company also sent the family a video of her performance and told them when the first show would be aired on TV.

She said: 'I am sure I loved the box of toys.

'No one knew how big the show was going to be so we didn't get offered royalties. '

She added: 'People told my mum that I should have gone into modeling but she thought it wasn't the right move to make as I was quite shy.'

Luckily Jess' little sister Lucy, now 17, hadn't been born when she took part in the filming so there were no arguments over who got the part.

The BBC is preparing to make 60 new episodes of the hugely popular 90s children's television show."

An eyewitness, Aamir Dhawan, who was at the scene, said people were reluctant to help the rapist, after seeing that his private parts had been cut off.

He said, ¡°No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime.

651,"Never one known for restraint, Vice Media¡¯s Shane Smith may now have outdone even himself.

Mr. Smith, the chief executive of the provocative news and entertainment group, spent $300,000 for a dinner at the Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio in Las Vegas during the International CES trade show in January, according to one person who was at the party and another one who knew about it.

Mr. Smith, whose company closed financing last September that valued it at $2.5 billion, paid for the meal personally. More than 30 people were at the dinner, including friends, other Vice executives and staff members and directors like Tom Freston, a founder and former chief executive of MTV who later went on to run Viacom, according to a person who attended the event.

Liquor flowed freely, with some bottles of wine costing more than $20,000, according to the people. The most expensive food item on the menu at the Prime Steakhouse, a Jean-Georges Vongerichten restaurant, is a 28-ounce bone-in rib eye for $85.

To foot the bill, Mr. Smith dipped into his more than $1 million in winnings from gambling, especially at the blackjack table, during the week, the people said.

News of the meal, which was first reported by Bloomberg, surfaced after executives at MGM Resorts International mentioned the outsize dinner bill during a company conference call on Tuesday. They cited it in response to a question from an analyst about how spending at the casino now compares with levels before the recession. MGM did not identify Mr. Smith as the guest who had hosted the dinner.

James J. Murren, the chief executive of MGM, said he had not seen a check that size for several years.

¡°People are starting to spend money remarkably here,¡± Mr. Murren said.

The lavish dinner is the latest caper by Mr. Smith, who is charting a new course as a brash next-generation media mogul. He is known to drink with old-school media executives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the hipster enclave where Vice has its headquarters. He has called CNN an expletive and rented villas at Cannes during an annual international media conference there.

¡°They live larger, and that is part of the Vice je ne sais quoi,¡± said Michael E. Kassan, the chief executive of the media and marketing consulting firm MediaLink, who is known to throw his own prominent industry dinners. ¡°But they do good stuff. I am a big fan. They represent so much of what is new and exciting in the world.¡±

Mr. Murren of MGM told the analyst Harry C. Curtis of Nomura Securities that he couldn¡¯t believe it when he first saw the tab. He said, ¡°$300,000 for dinner at Prime. That¡¯s a pretty good check. You would have liked the wine, Harry.¡±"
652,"The Apple Watch might have been four years in the making and the most Jony Ive-centric Apple product yet ? but the company didn¡¯t get everything it was wishing for from the device.

According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, Apple originally wanted its smartwatch to focus far more prominently on health-related innovations, only to be forced to go in another direction midway through the project.

If Apple had had its way, the Apple Watch would have boasted smart sensors capable of tracking blood pressure, heart rate and even stress levels ? but despite hiring top people from the biosensor industry, the technology didn¡¯t work quite as well as had been hoped.

Problems were apparently posed by Apple Watch wearers with hairy arms and dry skin, with sensor results also varying depending on how loosely or tightly the watch is worn. Despite a heavy drain on Apple resources, engineers were unable to create a suitable solution in time for the company to reveal the device.

As a result, the Apple Watch shipping in April will be far more of an iPhone accessory/companion than had originally been planned, which is no doubt useful for growing Apple¡¯s interlocking ecosystem but is less good in other ways. Although Apple has the luxury of taking its time with products, yesterday¡¯s New Yorker story reveals how much pressure there was to announce a new category of device post-Steve Jobs.

While there¡¯s still a lot to be excited for, the health-tracking applications of the Apple Watch were ones that people are very excited about. Apple has already had success introducing HealthKit into top hospitals, and a medically approved wearable could potentially help grow relations between Apple and the healthcare industry.

In a recent interview, Steve Wozniak discussed health-tracking as one of the most potentially exciting features of the Apple Watch. Cult of Mac has also written about the potential of the Apple Watch becoming your ¡°digital doctor.¡±

Sadly, it seems we¡¯re going to have to wait at least a couple of generations before the technology can live up to that billing."
653,"US officials say 11 commercial aircraft have gone missing from Tripoli International Airport in Libya ? ahead of the 13th anniversary of the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington.

The airport was the scene of a fierce battle that ended on August 26, when fighters from the Islamic Fajr Libya (Dawn of Libya) coalition captured the airport and aircraft belonging to the state-owned Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways.

Pictures from the airport in the aftermath of the fighting showed severely damaged and totally destroyed aircraft.

Dawn of Libya was identified as a terrorist organisation by the Libyan government earlier this year.

While the US State Department is down-playing the significance of the missing planes, one official was quoted in the Washington Free Beacon as saying: ¡®There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing. We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.¡¯

September 11 also marks the second anniversary of the raid of the US Ambassador¡¯s compound in Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans ? including including US Ambassador Christopher Stevens ? were killed.

Intelligence reports of the stolen aircraft include a warning that one or more of the planes could be used in terrorist attacks in the region. Another scenario involved using a plane with civilian markings to transport armed terrorists to an airport usually open to commercial aircraft.

Al Jazeera reported that the planes are being held by a group called the Masked Men Brigade, and it plans to use them in terror attacks.

Tunisia and Egypt have stopped flights to and from Libya, and countries including Algeria, Morocco and Nigeria are on high alert.

Locals got alerted by the girl's screams for help and found 40-year-old Suresh Kumar pinning the girl against a wall. The mob dragged him to a nearby butchers¡¯ shop where he was beaten up with sticks for an hour before castrating him, as reported on Friday.

The report said, the locals then dumped the severed remains in the middle of a road and left a bloodied Kumar nearby.

The Daily Mail quoted an eyewitness, Aamir Dhawan saying that no one 'went to help' Kumar because they knew he had been punished for a 'sex crime'

""""We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it's time it stopped. This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished,"""" Dhawan said.

¡°Given the rates of sexual violence perpetrated against women on college campuses, it is useful to examine any use of a term that suggests that a group of people just entering college might be targets for such violence in any way,¡± she added.

657,"Update at 8:50 p.m. EDT

The militant group that calls itself the Islamic State has released a video that purportedly shows the beheading of British aid worker David Haines.

The authenticity of the video, which appeared online Saturday, has not been independently confirmed by NPR.

The organization, also known as ISIS, had threatened to kill Haines just under two weeks ago, in an earlier video that showed the beheading of an American journalist. This weekend, Haines' family had issued a public plea to his captors through the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The family asked ISIS to make contact with them.

Haines, an international aid worker, was abducted in Syria in 2013. """"The British government had managed to keep his kidnapping secret out of concern for his safety until the most recent video Islamic State video identified him as a captive,"""" the AP writes.

The BBC reports that the 44-year-old father of two from Perth, Scotland, was kidnapped shortly after he began working with a French relief agency called ACTED. At his posting there, Haines was """"working in the Atmeh refugee camp ... supplying water, food and tents.""""

Over the past decade and a half he'd worked with a variety of aid agencies, writes the BBC: """"He had worked with a German charity on post-war reconstruction projects in Croatia, including housing and demining. He was also involved in efforts to help displaced people to return to their homes. In 2011 he became Head of Mission in Libya for Handicap International,"""" an organization that works to help vulnerable people with disabilities.

""""The following year he joined another agency, the Nonviolence Peaceforce (NP), and went to South Sudan,"""" where he worked as an unarmed civilian peacekeeper.

ISIS previously released two videos showing the beheadings of two American journalists, which were confirmed by U.S. officials to be authentic. The first video, which showed the killing of James Foley, was released on August 20. The second, which showed the beheading of Steven Sotloff and contained the threat directed towards Haines, was released on Sept. 2.

The newest video, like those previous videos, appears to name another Western hostage as a future target.

NPR's correspondent Alice Fordham, reporting for our Newscast unit, says the video begins with footage of British prime minister David Cameron. The two previous videos began with footage of President Obama.

The man identified as Haines, Alice reports, is shown """"kneeling in a featureless desert in an orange robe.""""

The video appears to be recent, Alice says: """"The assailant refers to the bombing of Iraq's Haditha dam a week ago. Another man identified as a British hostage appears at the end as the masked man exhorts Prime Minister Cameron to stop fighting the Islamic State.""""

Cameron has tweeted a response, writing, """"We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.""""

President Obama said in a statement that the U.S. """"strongly condemns the barbaric murder of UK citizen David Haines by the terrorist group ISIL,"""" and pledged to work with the U.K. and other nations to """"bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice."""""

Now presumably Apple might want to make some kind of announcement regarding the prices and the finalized specs of the device, and given that it is their first wearable, it doesn¡¯t seem like a stretch.
That being said, a report from French Apple website iGen (via AppleInsider) claims to have heard from their sources that this event could be held on the 24th of February in which Apple is expected to share the finalized specs and launch plans for the Apple Watch, and will also be announcing the rumored 12-inch MacBook Air.
Previously we have heard rumors that the 12-inch MacBook Air could be launched in Q1 2015 so an announcement either in February or by the end of March would coincide with the rumors. However we should also note that the folks at 9to5Mac have heard from their own sources that the 24th of February event will not be happening.
9to5Mac does not dispute the possibility of Apple holding a special event to launch their new products, but rather the actual date which their sources have told them will not be the 24th of February. Given that both websites have been pretty reliable when it comes to Apple rumors, it¡¯s hard to say who¡¯s right.

After he pushed past the female agent, he ran past the stairway that leads to the president¡¯s personal quarters before he was detained.

The Secret Service¡¯s response to Gonzalez¡¯s dash from the front railing was slowed because perimeter alarms ? dubbed ¡°crash boxes¡± ? had been muffled at the request of the White House¡¯s ushers.

The new revelation was published by the Washington Post and CBS.

The Post credited the new information to whistleblowers and Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight subcommittee on Homeland Security.

Chaffetz said the intrusion was a ¡°failure of leadership¡± by the Secret Service.

Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has said the intrusion was ¡°unacceptable¡± to her.

The report ? likely leaked by Chaffetz ? comes one day before Pierson testifies at his committee on Tuesday.

664,"Ahead of Monday's media event where Apple is expected to provide final details on the Apple Watch, a new report from TechCrunch details a hidden """"diagnostic port"""" inside one of the channels on the Apple Watch where watch bands slip into place. While the port is currently used only for diagnostic purposes, the report argues it could be used in the future to interface with """"smart band"""" accessories bringing additional functionality to the watch.The port has a 6-dot brass contact array inside the groove for the ¡®bottom¡¯ strap connector slot. Several sources have confirmed its existence and placement to me. It is very similar to the connector for the Lightning connector in iPhones, as that connector currently only uses 6 of its 8 available pins. Apple recently began opening up the Lightning port for use by third parties. A source says that this port is currently for diagnostic purposes only ? but that there is nothing preventing it from being a connection port for future accessories.TechCrunch's Matthew Panzarino is careful to state that he has no knowledge of any plans by Apple to launch such smart band accessories, but the idea remains an intriguing one. Possibilities for such bands include additional sensors, external batteries integrated into a band, and more.

Apple revealed a number of high-level details about the Apple Watch at the device's unveiling last September, but even now with a launch set for next month there is still much that remains unknown, including pricing details beyond the $349 starting price. Apple will undoubtedly address many of the details at Monday's events, but some of the technical details will likely need to wait until the device launches and users and technical experts can get a closer look at the device.

Update 2:13 PM: The diagnostic port will not be included on the Apple Watch that ships to consumers, according to 9to5Mac.

Residents of the northern Syrian city of Raqqa took photographs of remotely piloted planes flying over the area. Experts have identified the drones as 'US Predators', which were used in Pakistan and Yemen to attack suspected terrorists, The Telegraph reports.
The United States has not made this military activity public but there is a widespread expectation that the Obama Administration will be stepping up its efforts to defeat the hardliner Sunni militant outfit, which has captured swathes of area in Iraq's north and in Syria over the past few months, declaring  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as its 'Caliph'.
The reports of the unmanned drones being sent to target the self-proclaimed leader of the Sunni extremist organisation, is a clear indication that the US will not back down in their mission to annihilate the terrorist group that has proved to be the greatest threat to Washington in recent times, which according to Pentagon, even surpasses that once posed by al-Qaeda.
Even as President Obama has succeeded in assembling nine NATO nations that are willing to join the US in crushing the militant group, diplomatic efforts to win support were further bolstered on Monday when Iraq's parliament voted to approve a new government under Haider Al-Abadi's leadership. The new government is expected to cooperate fully with the US in its ambition to defeat the insurgents.
The United States is particularly hopeful of better days ahead as Abadi, who is a member of Iraq's Shiite majority had earlier promised to include Sunnis and Kurds in his government.

There was no immediate way to verify the claim by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. But it identified the hostage by name for the first time, and gave her address in Prescott, Ariz., apparently to add credibility to its message. The group also posted photographs of an obliterated house where, it said, Ms. Mueller's body had been buried beneath the rubble.

The White House said American intelligence officials were investigating the claim.

¡°We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports,¡± said Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council. ¡°We have not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates ISIL¡¯s claim.¡±

Jordanian officials cast doubt on the Islamic State's claim but did not explicitly rule it out. Jordan's foreign minister, Nasser S. Judeh, said on his Twitter account that the claim was ¡°An old and sick trick used by terrorists and despots for decades: claiming that hostages human shields held captive are killed by air raids.¡±

The Islamic State, which occupies parts of Syria and Iraq, has executed three other American hostages, all men, in beheadings that it posted on the Internet. An American-led coalition that includes Jordan and other Arab allies of the United States has been bombing Islamic State targets on a frequent basis for months.

Ms. Mueller, 26, the only known remaining American hostage held by the Islamic State, is a humanitarian aid worker who disappeared in August 2013 after she had driven into the northern Syria city of Aleppo with her Syrian boyfriend. Her colleagues received a proof-of-life video a few months later, showing her wearing a hijab and begging for her life.

Her family had asked news organizations to avoid identifying her by name while she was still in captivity. But the Islamic State's use of her name in its message on Friday changed their thinking, even though there was no proof she had been killed.

In a statement about Ms. Mueller, the family called her a passionate aid worker who had been taken captive by the Islamic State after she had left an Aleppo hospital run by Doctors Without Borders, the medical charity.

¡°The common threat of Kayla's life has been her quiet leadership and strong desire to serve others,"""" the statement said.

The immolation death of the Jordanian pilot, First Lt. Moaz al-Kasasbeh, 26, which was posted on the Internet in a carefully produced Islamic State video on Tuesday, generated new levels of world outrage. It was never made clear when the pilot, who was captured in late December, had been killed.

Jordan hung two convicted terrorist prisoners, including a woman, in retaliation on Wednesday and launched bombing attacks on Islamic State targets in neighboring Syria as a further response for vengeance.

A senior United States military official with knowledge of the targets attacked by the Jordanians said the targets in and around Raqqa that were struck were carefully vetted and scrutinized, as with previous strikes, and there were no indications in advance that any hostages were located at the facilities.

¡°The same high standards we apply to all targets in the vetting stage were applied to these,¡± said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss military operations. ¡°If there¡¯s any inkling a person like that was there, we don¡¯t go there.¡±

The official cautioned that without proof of the American hostage¡¯s death, the statement by the Islamic State could be a ploy to cause the Jordanians and the rest of the American-led coalition to refrain from any heavier airstrikes.

The official said though the Jordanian fighter jets took the lead in the strike in and around Raqqa, they were accompanied by American aircraft, as is standard on bombing runs over territory held by the Islamic State in Syria."

683,"A US journalist held by al-Qaeda in Yemen was killed by militants during an operation to rescue him, US and Yemeni officials say.

Luke Somers was shot by his captors during a raid by US forces, a US official told the New York Times.

His sister, Lucy Somers, told the Associated Press that she had been notified by the FBI of his death.

US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel confirmed the killing and said a second, non-US hostage, also died.

Yemen's defence ministry confirmed a """"major operation"""" had taken place in Yemen's southern Shabwa province on Saturday.

Mr Somers, who was kidnapped in Yemen in 2013, had appeared in a video appealing for help.

""""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,"""" Lucy Somers told AP, speaking from London.

A drone strike believed to have been carried out by the US is reported to have killed nine suspected al-Qaeda militants in the region.

Mr Somers, 33, worked as a journalist and photographer for local news organisations. His material appeared on international news outlets, including the BBC News website.

He was kidnapped outside a supermarket in the Yemeni capital Sana'a in September 2013 and is believed to have been sold on to al-Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula (AQAP).

The video of him released this week showed a member of AQAP threatening to kill Mr Somers unless unspecified demands were met.

The Pentagon confirmed that an an attempt to rescue Mr Somers last month had failed.

His family appealed in a video to al-Qaeda militants in Yemen to """"show mercy"""" and release him.

""""Luke is only a photojournalist and is not responsible for any actions the US government has taken,"""" his brother, Jordan, said in a video.

AQAP is regarded by the US as one of the deadliest offshoots of al-Qaeda.

The group is based in eastern Yemen and has built up support amid the unrest which has beset the impoverished country since the overthrow of President Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2011."

687,"Robots are increasingly replacing humans in a variety of mundane tasks, like bolting a car together or making lollipops, but now they are moving into the security business.

Microsoft recently installed a fleet of 5-feet-tall, 300-pound robots to protect its Silicon Valley campus. The robots are packed with HD security cameras and sensors to take in their organic, protein-based surroundings. There¡¯s also an artificial intelligence on board that can sound alarms when the robot notices something awry. It can also read license plates and cross-reference them to see if they¡¯re stolen.

The K5 robots come from a California company called Knightscope, which calls the robots ¡°autonomous data machines¡± that provide a ¡°commanding but friendly presence.¡± Sounds like something a robot manufacturer would say.

Let¡¯s be honest though, the robots look pretty damn cool. They¡¯re like modern versions of R2-D2.

Thankfully?or sadly, depending on how you look at it?the K5 robots don¡¯t have any weapons on them. All they can do is assess a situation, sound an alarm to defuse it, or call a human security officer to the scene. There are, however, plans equip the robots with tasers sometime in the future.

Microsoft¡¯s new protectors are fairly autonomous. A single charge will last 24 hours, and if the robot notices that its battery is getting low, it will return to a charging port and plug itself in. It can fully recharge in 20 minutes, which is pretty insane.

There are plans to one day expand the use of Knightscope¡¯s robots and have them patrol the streets as part of human police units. We can¡¯t even imagine what would happen if Elon Musk heard about this.

688,"The Islamic State terror group has burned the corpses of five of its fighters due to the belief that they had contracted the deadly Ebola virus, according to an Iraqi health official who told Kurdish paper Rudaw.

¡°The Islamic State organization incinerated five militants infected with Ebola to prevent further spread of the disease in Mosul (Iraq),¡± said Faisal Ghazi, who is part of Iraq¡¯s Health Committee in its council of ministries. He added, ¡°ISIS had proof that these militants were infected with Ebola.¡±

On New Year¡¯s Day, Breitbart News reported that multiple Iraqi and Kurdish news outlets had claimed that Islamic State fighters in Mosul, Iraq had contracted the deadly virus. Iraqi news outlets claimed at the time that Ebola had started to spread in a Mosul hospital.

A World Health Organization (WHO) official told Mashable at the time, ¡°We have no official notification from the Iraqi government that it is Ebola.

Kurdish news site Xendan elaborated further, reporting that the ISIS fighters¡¯ symptoms were similar to those who had contracted Ebola. An Iraqi paper claimed that the virus had made its way into Mosul through jihadists who were recruited out of Africa.

However, most of the Islamic State¡¯s Africa-based recruits have come from countries where Ebola has not had a documented presence. It also remains unclear whether Mosul health officials would even have the means, training or education necessary to test for Ebola. Furthermore, an Iraqi government spokesman, Ahmed Rudaini, told Al-Maalomah News that Mosul simply doesn¡¯t have the technology available to confirm an Ebola case."
689,"(CNN) -- The mystery surrounding North Korea's erratic young leader, Kim Jong Un, only deepens by the day.

He has not been seen publicly in more than a month.  Rumors are flying that Kim is ill with gout, diabetes, even possible problems with his ankles. Now, a group of defectors say they believe Kim's younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, may be running the country while he recuperates.

The North Korea Intellectuals' Solidarity, a think-tank run by defectors, says Kim Yo Jong may be at least temporarily leading the government. The group has not revealed the source of its information, and CNN cannot independently confirm it. But Kim Yo Jong's star appears to be rising.

Why has North Korea decided to talk now?

Michael Madden, who runs the blog North Korea Leadership Watch, says Kim Yo Jong has been identified in North Korean media as deputy director of the Workers' Party, a very powerful position.

Victor Cha, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who previously handled the North Korea account with the National Security Council, says Kim Yo Jong began surfacing publicly earlier this year at party functions.

""""Clearly it's an effort to slow-track her into becoming somebody who is important within the system,"""" Cha says. """"I can see how it's possible that she's in some sort of temporary position. It's very difficult for the North Korean system to run without one of the Kim family at least titularly in charge. So, if Kim Jong Un is indisposed, she's really the only available body that's left, in terms of a direct Kim family line.""""

Is Kim Jong Un still in charge of North Korea?

Who is Kim Yo Jong?

Madden says Kim Yo Jong was born in 1987 or 1988, and attended private school in Switzerland with Kim Jong Un. They both stayed at the North Korean embassy while attending the Swiss school, Madden says, and lived there under assumed names.

Madden says Kim Yo Jong is the youngest of seven siblings their father, Kim Jong Il, had with four women. Many of them are half-siblings, but Kim Jong Un and Kim Yo Jong have the same mother.

Opinion: Why Kim is probably still in charge

Madden says Kim Yo Jong was always close to her father, and after returning from Switzerland, she was appointed to positions of responsibility in the government. She would act as an advance-team leader, inspecting sites before official visits, and had administrative duties as well.

Now, he says, she continues those duties and has taken on more responsibility under her brother's rule: dealing with policy and receiving intelligence briefings. She acts """"almost like a White House chief-of-staff would,"""" Madden says.

He says he believes she had a large role in planning the recent trip by three top North Korean officials to South Korea while her brother was absent from the scene.

Opinion: Why Kim is probably still in charge

Ready for prime time?

Given her age and that so little is known about Kim Yo Jong, North Korea-watchers are concerned about her being in the top leadership spot, if only temporarily. The stress and palace intrigue inside the North Korean regime, they say, may be overwhelming.

""""If in fact she is running the country -- as someone in their early to mid twenties, to me that is quite alarming,"""" Cha says. """"It means there is something seriously wrong with Kim Jong Un and there is some sort of void that they're desperately trying to fill.""""

All eyes will be on a significant event this Friday, October 10. That's the 69th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party. Kim Jong Un attended the anniversary event last year. If he doesn't show up at Friday's ceremonies, concern over his public disappearance will only grow.

If he does attend, intelligence analysts will be looking at his appearance, his body language -- every detail -- very carefully.

690,"Apple¡¯s next-generation MacBook Air, which is expected to come with a 12-inch screen, will have a ¡°radically new design¡± that will abandon traditional specifications to produce a noticeably thinner and lighter device compared to the current 11-inch model, according to a report.

The upcoming MacBook Air is expected to be about a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, while also sporting a quarter-of-an-inch taller body in order to incorporate the slightly larger display, 9to5Mac reported, citing ¡°sources within Apple¡± with access to ¡°internal prototype versions¡± of the device. The bezels on the display could also be narrowed out on all sides to get a larger display fitted into the footprint, which is about the same size as the current 11-inch version's.

In addition to the 12-inch screen, the new MacBook Air could also feature an edge-to-edge keyboard with a redesigned key set, allowing each key to sit closer together, the report said, adding that the move is said to be aimed at making the computer as compact as possible.

The new model could also feature a revamped trackpad with the same width as that found on the 11-inch version, but with a taller frame almost touching the bottom of the keyboard, 9to5Mac reported, adding that the new trackpad may come without the clicking effect found on existing MacBook models.

Just above the keyboard of the next-generation MacBook Air, there could be four new speaker grilles that are expected to also function as ventilation ports, as the device lacks traditional computer fans.

In a bid to achieve a significantly thinner form factor, the 12-inch MacBook Air could do away with standard USB ports, the SD Card slot, and Thunderbolt and MagSafe charging standards in favor of a single USB Type-C port, which is reportedly smaller, faster and better than the existing USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports. In addition, the USB Type-C port is reversible, similar to that of the Lightning connector on the latest iOS devices. While the new USB Type-C port will sit on the left side of the device, the right side will accommodate the headphone jack, along with input and noise-canceling microphones, according to the report.

The details of the 12-inch MacBook Air closely follow recent rumors that the device could enter mass production in the first quarter of 2015. According to a report from Taiwan¡¯s DigiTimes in December, Apple¡¯s suppliers were stocking up inventory of related components for the new MacBook Air, in anticipation of the device entering production."
691,"Update: The original source of the story, Bloomberg now adds that the face of Michelle Obama was not blurred by the State TV. It quotes several journalists from within Saudi Arabia covering the event, adding that the State TV in fact did not blur the face of the First Lady anyway.

According to Nail al-Jubeir, information director at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, the blurring isn¡¯t real.

¡°Saudi TV has been showing the total arrival ceremony at the airport and at the Palace and nowhere is anything blurred.¡±

CNN correspondent Hala Gorani also tweeted out that the Saudi TV in fact did not blur Michelle Obama¡¯s face.

Our Nic Robertson in Riyadh telling me footage he saw on Saudi TV did not show a blurred Michelle Obama. On that note, Good night Twitter!

? Hala Gorani (@HalaGorani) January 27, 2015

Original Story:

U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama might have found it apt to cut short their trip to India to pay homage to former Saudi King Abdullah, who passed away last week. The Saudis, however, don¡¯t seem to be enamored by the presence of the First Lady in their country.

According to a report by Bloomberg, the Saudi state television allegedly blurred out the face of Michelle Obama during a brief televised meeting between the new Saudi King Salman and the President at Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. In fact, the new King reportedly refused to acknowledge the presence of the First Lady and did not say hello or shake hands with her, the report adds. Other media houses from the Middle East, however, showed the unedited footage of the meeting without obscuring the face of Michelle Obama.

Hours after the state TV ran those clips, several of them were posted to Facebook, reports the Washington Times. However, most of the videos were subsequently taken down ? probably at the behest of Saudi¡¯s Internet Police. A version of the clip is now up on YouTube. We are unsure, however, how long it would remain there. We have managed to capture a screenshot of the video, just in case. The video is embedded below.

Meanwhile, Michelle Obama also faced criticism from some Arab media outlets for her decision to wear blue on her visit. They added that the First Lady should have worn a black dress, which is more appropriate for a funeral. Also pertinent to note was the fact that Michelle Obama did not wear a head scarf during the time she was out in public. As per Saudi law, all women in the country, even visitors, are required by law to wear a head scarf while in public. This is perhaps why the state TV blurred the First Lady out entirely.

There is also talk about the new Saudi King insulting Barack Obama by breaking protocol. The new King apparently abruptly turned around and walked away from the President in order to go for a prayer. This, however, could have been due to the inexperience of the new King, others allege.

Later in the day, the Saudi King held bilateral talks with other senior staff, including Secretary of State John Kerry, Senator John McCain, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Ambassador Joseph Westphal, and CIA director John Brennan. A statement by the White House later announced the following.

¡°Obama and Salman sat in gold chairs. A small table in front of them held a spray of white flowers.¡±

The alleged decision by the Saudi state television to blur the face of Michelle Obama once again raises the question of women¡¯s rights in Saudi Arabia. The country has strict laws that restrict freedom of movement of women. In fact, it was only recently that the country gave womenfolk the right to vote. It is also the only country in the world where women are not allowed to drive. Now, with even the wife of the world¡¯s most powerful man being targeted, albeit indirectly, the world is certain to take note.

A video shared online made it seem as if Vladimir Putin got some unwelcome love from a feathered friend Sunday during a speech unveiling a monument to Russians who served in World War I.

Putin was speaking about the sacrifice made by Russian soldiers in World War I, linking the Great War to his own current political troubles. ¡°This tragedy reminds us what happens when aggression, selfishness and the unbridled ambitions of national leaders and political establishments push common sense aside, so that instead of preserving the world¡¯s most prosperous continent, Europe, they lead it towards danger,¡± he said. ¡°It is worth remembering this today.¡±

The hashtag refers to a meme that blew up after a Fox contributor declared that certain British cities had been swallowed whole by Muslim immigrants. ¡°In Britain, it¡¯s not just no-go zones, there are actual cities like Birmingham that are totally Muslim where non-Muslims just simply don¡¯t go in,¡± said Steve Emerson, whose statement was so absurd that it was actually debunked by British PM David Cameron himself.

698,"Amazon boss Jeff Bezos is primed and ready for a fresh assault on the streaming-video space.

The e-commerce giant will roll out a new ad-supported streaming offering early next year that will be separate from its $99-a-year Prime membership, which includes a video service, sources said.

The ad-supported option ? part of an overhaul of its media offerings ? poses a serious challenge to streaming rivals such as Hulu and Netflix, analysts said.

¡°If they do an ad-supported service, they will decouple it from Prime and that is a Netflix killer,¡± Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. ¡°It won¡¯t be $99 a year.¡±

Pachter suggested Amazon would undercut Netflix¡¯s current monthly price of $7.99.

¡°Who wouldn¡¯t switch if you were poor or you¡¯re a cord-cutter?¡± he added.

Although it will be separate from Prime, the ad-supported service is ultimately a bid by Amazon to lure people to eventually pay up for Prime membership, said one ad source familiar with Amazon¡¯s plans.

¡°The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesn¡¯t want to pay for Prime, in order to increase their video share,¡± the source said.

The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Amazon was weighing such a move, but sources confirmed that it¡¯s a definite go.

Amazon is prepping a new attack at a time when its video service is gaining ground, sources said. Amazon doesn¡¯t disclose the number of Prime members, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates it has 50 million global customers.

While Prime¡¯s big draw has been two-day shipping, about half of Prime subscribers use the video service that is included with it, or around 25 million, sources said. By comparison, Netflix has 33 million domestic subscribers.

A recent Sandvine study also shows that Amazon is making major strides ? but has a long way to go before catching Netflix. Amazon¡¯s broadband traffic on fixed networks grew from 1.61 percent to 2.58 percent, the study showed. One change is that Amazon snagged popular HBO content, including ¡°The Wire,¡± ¡°True Blood¡± and ¡°Boardwalk Empire.¡± Netflix accounts for 32.39 percent of aggregate traffic.

Rumors have been rampant that Amazon plans to let advertisers into its media ecosystem. Amazon has already experimented with ads in some shows, according to tech site Re/code.

For advertisers, the service could be the Holy Grail in terms of targeting. In theory, Amazon could tell if ads viewed online led to purchases on its retail site.

The news that Nielsen will start rating shows on subscription video services starting with Netflix is likely to encourage advertisers who want to make the leap without forcing Amazon to give up its own data.

Amazon will also have leverage over content producers when it comes to the way it chooses to promote shows and movies within its growing ecosystem, a Hollywood source said.

Amazon didn¡¯t return a call seeking comment."

702,"Mexico's attorney general says DNA tests have shown that 28 bodies found in a mass grave are not those of a missing group of students.

Jesus Murillo Karam said further tests were being carried out on four other recently discovered grave sites.

The 43 students went missing three weeks ago amid violent protests in Iguala, south of Mexico City.

Mr Karam said 14 more police officers had been arrested, accused of handing the students over to a drugs gang.

About 50 people have been arrested in connection with the students' disappearance, with the vast majority being local police officers.

The officers are believed to have been working for a drugs gang, known as the Guerreros Unidos.

On Tuesday, police said the gang's leader, Benjamin Mondragon, had killed himself when he was about to be arrested during an operation by Mexican security forces in the state of Morelos.

The missing students all attended a teacher training college in Iguala, some 200km (125 miles) south of Mexico City.

The college has a history of left-wing activism but it is not clear whether the students were targeted for their political beliefs.

Renewed hope

They disappeared after deadly clashes with the police on 26 September in which six people died. Eyewitnesses reported seeing them being bundled into police vans.

Will Grant, the BBC's Mexico correspondent, says confirmation the missing students were not found in mass graves will give their families renewed hope.

Many of the families are camped out in Iguala waiting for answers from the local authorities.

On Monday, crowds of fellow students and teachers from the teaching college set fire to Guerrero state headquarters in the city of Chilpancingo.

They are angry at a perceived lack of progress in the investigation and have called for state governor Angel Aguirre to resign.

Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has vowed to find and punish those responsible for the disappearances, saying the incident was """"shocking, painful and unacceptable""""."

The film - which will reportedly not be a traditional biopic - is expected to follow the late technology whiz during three stressful and high profile product launches throughout Apple's history.

While talking with Bloomberg on Thursday, 53-year-old Aaron Sorkin revealed that British actor Christian Bale would be playing the title role in Jobs.

¡®What we needed was the best actor,¡¯ Sorkin said of Bale, who won an Oscar for his supporting role in 2010¡¯s The Fighter (filmed between instalments of Bale¡¯s Batman movies).

Winner: Despite years of critically acclaimed roles, Bale won his first Academy Award for The Fighter in 2011

Christian was again nominated for an Oscar for 2013¡¯s American Hustle and has been a critically acclaimed actor since starring in Steven Spielberg¡¯s Empire Of The Sun at 14.

Despite being best known as a superhero, Bale is known for physically transforming himself thoroughly between roles and thus should be fine to take on the more cerebral Jobs role.

Before his death in 2011 from pancreatic cancer, Jobs gained a reputation as an excellent speaker, in addition to his work in creating and then transforming Apple Computers.

It¡¯s a big leap from Batman to Jobs, but if there¡¯s one actor who can play both muscle-bound Bruce Wayne and skinny Steve Jobs, it is Christian Bale.

Chameleon: Bale tends to change his look between films, meaning this October 14 photo in Los Angeles is not likely to resemble the actor in Jobs"
706,"Arrived in the convent of Macerata in June last year, the religious is of South American origin. But the abbess denied: """"No sister gave birth to a child.""""

A young cloistered nun, of Bolivian origin and 35 years, gave birth to a baby at the hospital Bartolomeo Eustachio San Severino Marche (Macerata). When she arrived at the hospital, brought by the sisters worried about his health, complained a strong stomach ache. Performed the ultrasound, the truth was immediately clear and the nun, Sunday, was transferred in obstetrics, where a few hours after she gave birth to a child. Great secrecy is maintained on each other. The nun would however confided to doctors the decision to hold the child and will probably entrusted to a host community. For the moment, the baby was conducted to investigations in Neonatology Hospital of Macerata. It would be in good health, but being born after a pregnancy held without health checks, it is preferred to subject it to more accurate analyzes. No comment for now by the bishop of Camerino Francesco Brugnaro.

In San Severino cloistered convents are two, Santa Rita and Santa Caterina, but in the area there are many other religious structures. The Mother Abbess of the monastery of St. Clare of San Severino explained that the nun who gave birth is not """"cloistered"""" in one of the convents of the area. """"The story - he said - not about any Poor Clare Sister of our community, nor sisters of monasteries in the area."""" """"Let me say this - he added - categorically to dispel any doubt and refute inaccurate information circulating at the moment and that led many journalists to contact our address.""""

VERSION OF THE CONVENT - From the convent of the Missionary Sisters of the Love of the Heart of Christ of San Severino Marche ensure that the young woman who has given birth """"is not a nun, is a girl that we are helping."""" But certainly we know that is from Bolivia and her age. Several sources ensure that this is just a religious, but the sisters did not want to add anything else, without explaining even if the woman has or has not taken vows.

707,"A female worker reportedly gives out fake ratings to apps by physically going handset to handset. (Internet photo)

A photo recently uploaded online in China showing someone reportedly working on an array of mobile phones has gone viral overnight, as it gives a glimpse into China's app-ranking manipulation factory, reports Tencent Technology.

In the photo posted on to China's Weibo microblog, a woman with about a hundred iPhones placed before her appears to be giving out fake ratings to apps by going phone by phone.

About a hundred fake ratings, which have the potential to affect the top lists of Apple's App Store, can be created within an hour or two.

Apple has had adopted a number of measures to crackdown on fake downloads and cheating the rankings, including lowering the price of apps to only 1 yuan (US$0.16) which the company hopes could draw more real users to rate.

Yet given the fact that people in China are physically simulating real users, as seen in the leaked photo, it would be tough to crack down on the industry.

Numbers are important, as a majority of users refer to ratings when it comes to downloading apps. Those with better ratings have a much higher chance of being downloaded."

709,"A hoax story about street artist Banksy being arrested in Watford has duped internet users.

US website National Report alleged the Metropolitan Police had held the elusive graffiti artist after he was traced by a """"24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force"""".

It claimed his art studio in the capital had been raided and ¡°thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism¡± found.

The story also said documents identified the anonymous artist as 35-year-old Paul Homer, from Liverpool.

He was said to be in custody ¡°without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting¡±.

However, Scotland Yard confirmed the story - which left Banksy's name trending on Twitter - was fake.

A spokesman said: """"We are certainly not aware of Banksy being arrested in Watford, or anywhere else for that matter.""""

The story hit a chord with Louise Mensch, the former Conservative MP who is active on Twitter.

She fell for the scam and criticised the Metropolitan Police for not focusing on the """"so many other criminals out there"""".

But she quickly apologised when she was alerted to the story being a prank.

The story fooled thousands of others on social media, who expressed shock that the infamous artist had been unmasked at last.

However, there were several clear discrepancies in the National Report story.

It mentions Banksy was arrested by the Metropolitan Police and the City of London Police, which are different forces.

The report quotes """"London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards"""", which is a fictional name, and uses a picture of an arrest ahead of the Notting Hill Carnival in 2011."

Danny Boyle is directing the untitled film, based on Walter Isaacson's book and adapted by Aaron Sorkin, which is one of the most anticipated biopics in recent years.

Negotiations have not yet begun, and it¡¯s not even clear if Rogen has an official offer, but the producers ? Scott Rudin, Guymon Casady and Mark Gordon ? have set their sights on the talent and are in talks.

Of course, this may all be for naught as Christian Bale, the actor who is to play Jobs, is still in the midst of closing his deal. Sources say that dealmaking process is in a sensitive stage.

Insiders say Boyle will is flying to Los Angeles to meet with actress to play one of the female leads, an assistant to Jobs. Insiders say that Jessica Chastain is one of the actresses on the meeting list.

714,"Canadian national and former Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldier Gill Rosenberg, 31, revealed to the Israeli media earlier this month that she had traveled to Iraq to help the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) fight off ISIS.
""""They are our brothers,"""" she told Israel Radio of the Kurds. """"They are good people. They love life, a lot like us, really.""""
Now, just three weeks later, there are rumors she may be in ISIS custody. Posts on ISIS-affiliated web forums, including Al Platform Media, claim the """"Zionist soldier"""" was captured while fighting with the Kurds against ISIS in Kobane, a small majority-Kurdish town along Syria's northern border with Turkey.
There has indeed been intense fighting in Kobane between ISIS and the YPG over the past 24 hours. However, YPG sources have strongly denied to the Journal and other outlets that Rosenberg was captured.
So far, neither group has provided evidence either way, and ISIS has yet to release an official statement.

A spokesperson at the IDF news desk told the Journal that the IDF is not keeping track of Rosenberg, and """"does not have a way of knowing"""" if she's been captured by ISIS. Minister of Defense Moshe Ya'alon, too, told Channel 2 that he had no information on Rosenberg's whereabouts.
Rosenberg, formerly a resident of Tel Aviv, did post to Facebook on Nov. 20 that she would be taking a short leave from social media.
""""My Facebook account and friend requests are being managed by someone else until I have access again in apx 2 weeks time on or around week of 12/8,"""" she wrote. """"Please do not message as this is not me. Thank you.""""
A couple weeks before that, right around her 31st birthday, Rosenberg posted photos of herself on the Iraqi-Syrian border, and wrote: """"In the IDF, we say ????? - After Me. Let's show ISIS what that means.""""
 

 

 
A friend of hers from the IDF told the Journal that he remembered Rosenberg as """"a cute lady with a strong ideology."""" On Twitter, her tagline is: """"On a spiritual journey and a quest for authenticity.""""
Her attraction to foreign battlgrounds aside, the IDF-turned-YPG warrior has a pretty bizarre backstory. She reportedly served a few years in U.S. prison for a phone scam that she ran out of Israel, in which elderly Americans were """"bilked out of millions of dollars, collectively,"""" according to the FBI.
Since news of her possible capture broke, friends and supporters have filled her Facebook wall with respects, prayers and side-by-side photos of the Israeli and Kurdish flags.

ISIS members writing on the Al Platform Media forum urged leaders to use Rosenberg as a bargaining chip for a prisoner exchange with Israel.
In a phone interview with the Journal, Emmanuel Nachshon, spokesman for the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, distanced the government from Rosenberg. """"She¡¯s her own person,"""" he said. """"As an individual, she¡¯s free to do whatever she wants. We're not in a position to tell her what to do. ... Remember, she didn¡¯t go there as an Israeli. She never said, 'I¡¯m representing Israel.'""""
Nachshon said the foreign ministry was aware Rosenberg was fighting for the Kurds, but has not been able to confirm the kidnapping rumors. """"Our researchers are looking into it,"""" he said. (CBC News in Canada reports that the Canadian foreign ministry is likewise """"pursuing all appropriate channels"""" to locate Rosenberg.)
Asked if Israel was expecting ISIS to try and negotiate, Nachshon said: """"I hear they are more in the business of cutting heads.""""
Updates to come as story develops."
715,"MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) ? Nicaragua's government said Sunday that a mysterious boom heard overnight in the capital was made by a small meteorite that left a crater in a wooded area near Managua's airport.

Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a """"relatively small"""" meteorite that """"appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.""""

Murillo said Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.

The crater left by the meteorite had a radius of 12 meters (39 feet) and a depth of 5 meters (16 feet), said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.

Humberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.

""""We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,"""" he said.

Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was """"very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.""""

Local residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn't see anything strange in the sky.

""""I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,"""" Jorge Santamaria told The Associated Press.

The site of the crater is near Managua's international airport and an air force base. Only journalists from state media were allowed to visit it."
716,"The man who broke into the White House two weeks ago was able to make his way far into the property before being tackled in the East Room -- the room where President Obama and many other presidents have made some of their most important announcements, a law enforcement official confirmed today to ABC News.

The development calls into question the narrative originally released by the Secret Service, which had suggested that Omar Gonzalez, 42, of Texas, had been taken into custody near the front doors of the White House after jumping the fence and running more the 100 yards into the national landmark.

¡°Gonzalez failed to comply with responding Secret Service Uniformed Division Officers¡¯ verbal commands, and was physically apprehended after entering the White House North Portico doors,¡± the Secret Service said in a statement on Sept. 20.

When he jumped over the fence outside of the White House, Gonzalez was allegedly carrying a folding pocket knife. After pushing through the front doors, he ran to the East Room, according to the official, confirming details first reported by The Washington Post.

A Secret Service spokesperson declined to comment, but the agency¡¯s director, Julie Pierson, will be on the hot seat Tuesday as the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hold a hearing to examine several issues dogging the Secret Service.

In an interview with ABC News, the chairman of the committee, Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said Gonzalez got deep enough into the White House that had President Obama or Vice President Joe Biden been there ¡°they could have been attacked.¡±

Signs of increased security around the White House were almost immediate after Gonzales made it into the complex, including additional barriers outside of the White House gates. In addition, the Secret Service beefed-up foot patrols along the fence line of the White House complex and deployed additional surveillance resources, a White House spokesman said at the time.

Gonzalez had been homeless in the nation¡¯s capital for the past three months after 13 years in the U.S. Army, including a tour in Iraq."
718,"Amazon is going to open a brick-and-mortar store in New York City in time for holiday shopping, The Wall Street Journal reports.

The Journal's sources say the store will be located in Manhattan on 34th Street, across from the Empire State Building, and will give Amazon a way to connect with customers in the physical world.

The store would reportedly function like a mini-warehouse, with inventory for same-day delivery in New York City, and would also act as a hub for product returns, exchanges, and pickup of online orders. Sources also said that Amazon might use the space to showcase products like its new Kindle tablets, its Fire smartphone, and its TV box, Fire TV.

People familiar with the plans told The Wall Street Journal that nothing was set in stone yet, and the company may decide to ditch the idea. However, if Amazon does open the store and has a successful launch, it may open more brick-and-mortar locations in other US cities.

Amazon has experimented with pop-up shops in the past ? last year, it put Kindle vending machines in malls across the country ? but this would be its biggest, riskiest attempt. As The Journal points out, opening up physical locations wouldn't be cheap: Leases, new employees, and managing inventory would all cut into the company's already thin profit margins.

Amazon's potential location would be 7 West 34th Street, an area that sees a lot of foot-traffic because of its proximity to the Empire State Building and ample shopping.

719,"In North Korea, no one can have the same name as supreme leader Kim Jong Un.

According to reports, North Korea previously banned anyone from sharing the name Jong Un. Newborns cannot be given the name, and citizens who bore it before the ban were required to assume new names.

South Korean media outlets including KBS and Yonhap News Agency said the name ban was contained in a directive from 2011 which was issued months before Kim Jong Un came to power and was only recently leaked outside North Korea.

The leaked document said that ¡°all party organs and public security authorities¡± should identify residents who shared the supreme leader's name and """"train them to voluntarily change [it],¡± per The Guardian.

People named Jong Un -- said to be a common Korean name for both men and women -- apparently were directed to change their names on official documents such as birth certificates, social security cards and school diplomas.

According to the BBC, it was likely that there was ¡°little forewarning¡± of the name ban, since Kim Jong Un -- the youngest son of predecessor Kim Jong Il -- had been relatively unknown to the general public prior to his ascension to head of state.

A South Korean government official this week confirmed the authenticity of the directive, reports The New York Times.

¡°It¡¯s true that in North Korea, they now allow only one [Jong Un],¡± the official, who was unnamed, told the paper.

According to Yonhap News Agency, the Pyongyang regime issued a similar name ban when Kim Jong Il was in power and when his father, North Korea's founding leader Kim Il Sung, was as well."
720,"DNA tests have confirmed that a daughter and an ex-wife of the head of Isis, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, are indeed being held by Lebanese authorities.

There have been conflicting reports about the identity of the woman, with an Iraqi official denying on Wednesday she was al-Baghdadi's ex wife.

But a Lebanese interior minister confirmed today that the woman and child who were detained about 10 days ago in northern Lebanon travelling with a fake ID are in fact the ex wife and daughter of the terrorist leader.

Islamic State (IS) group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi addresses worshippers at a mosque in Mosul, after he established a self-declared caliphate across Iraq and Syria on July 5, 2014

The woman, who has been named as Saja al-Dulaimi, was travelling with two sons and a daughter, Interior Minister Nouhad Mashnuq told the Lebanese MTV channel late Wednesday.

He said DNA tests showed that the girl was Baghdadi's child.

'Dulaimi is not Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's wife currently. She has been married three times: first to a man from the former Iraqi regime, with whom she had two sons,' he said.

'Six years ago she married Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi for three months, and she had a daughter with him. Now, she is married to a Palestinian and she is pregnant with his child,' Mashnuq added.

'We conducted DNA tests on her and the daughter, which showed she was the mother of the girl, and that the girl is his (Baghdadi's) daughter, based on DNA from Baghdadi from Iraq,' the minister said.

The woman, who has been named as Saja al-Dulaimi (pictured), was travelling with two sons and a daughter, Interior Minister Nouhad Mashnuq told the Lebanese MTV channel late Wednesday

He gave no details on Dulaimi's nationality, but a security source said she was believed to be Iraqi.

Mashnuq offered no further information about her current husband, although he said investigations showed the woman had ties to extremists in Lebanon.

Dulaimi's children were at a children's care centre while she was being interrogated, he said.

Mashnuq also confirmed the arrest of the wife of Anas Sharkas, a leader in Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Al-Nusra Front.

Dulaimi was among a group of female prisoners released from Syrian jails in March, in exchange for 13 nuns from the ancient town of Maalula held by Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate Al-Nusra Front.

The Islamic State (IS) group has yet to comment publicly on Dulaimi's detention, but Al-Nusra, despite a feud with Baghdadi's group, issued a statement of condemnation.

It described her as 'sister Saja al-Dulaimi' and said the arrest of women and children was evidence of the 'weakness' of the Lebanese state.

Sources said the detention of Dulaimi and Sharkas's wife could help the Lebanese as they struggle to negotiate the release of 27 members of the security forces held by jihadists from IS and Al-Nusra.

The soldiers and police were abducted when militants from the two groups briefly overran the Lebanese border town of Arsal in August.

The fighters withdrew after a truce negotiated by clerics, but took 30 hostages, three of whom have been executed."
721,"On Monday¡¯s edition of CNN Tonight, host Don Lemon released audio allegedly recorded in the Canfield apartment complex at the exact time of Michael Brown¡¯s death on Aug. 9. The audio features a man speaking via video chat about unrelated topics (¡°You are pretty,¡± he says at one point). The recording is regarded as such an important piece of evidence, however, because one can clearly hear at least 10 gunshots ring out over the course of the 12-second file ? first a group of six shots, then four more.

The man¡¯s attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, appeared on CNN to discuss the tape: ¡°I was very concerned about that pause ¡¦ because it¡¯s not just the number of gunshots, it¡¯s how they¡¯re fired. And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.¡± She has since reached out to the FBI, which has sent representatives to meet with Blumenthal and her client. ¡°They thought this would be an important part of the investigation,¡± she said.

¡°At the time, he didn¡¯t even realize the import of what he was hearing,¡± Blumenthal said.

CNN reports on what the new evidence could indicate:
Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots.

¡°It¡¯s the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless ? he has no weapon,¡± said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell.

Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer.

But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn¡¯t automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.

¡°To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,¡± said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN¡¯s Crossfire. ¡°Maybe the officer will say, ¡®Well I fired, and he kept advancing, so I fired again.¡¯¡±

Lemon cautioned: ¡°CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of this tape and has reached out to the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the Ferguson resident who says he made the recording."
722,"When Tim Cook finally announced the long-awaited Apple Watch on September 9, the company promised an ¡°early 2015¡± release. Since then, it¡¯s really been anybody¡¯s guess as to when, exactly, that might end up being. A few new rumors, however, suggest that we¡¯ll get the Apple Watch sometime in February¡¦but it¡¯s likely that it¡¯ll be later than that.

Today, a post on 9to5Mac points the way back to a report from Chinese site Feng, which itself cites ¡°Taiwanese media¡± as saying that the Apple Watch is likely to hit sometime in February, though not without a fair bit of challenges to overcome. The reports say that the supply of sapphire crystal ? which will compose the displays of the highest-end Apple Watch units ? has led to some difficulties in manufacturing.

However, it should be noted that if sapphire is the biggest problem facing the Apple Watch, then Apple¡¯s in good shape. The software itself is still in development, and as the 9to5Mac post points out, the company has yet to release the WatchKit SDK for developers to start making all the cool apps that¡¯ll run on the device.

Another report from Asia this week claims that production on the Apple Watch isn¡¯t set to start at manufacturing partner Quanta until sometime in January ? and with only a month of actual production, it seems doubtful that Apple would truly be ready to sell the Watch by February. And last week, an unnamed Apple insider was quoted as saying that the company would be ¡°lucky to ship it by Valentine¡¯s Day.¡± If that quote is true, then February seems like a tall order.

That said, March doesn¡¯t seem too out of the question. Nor does April. In fact, considering that Motorola promised the Moto 360 smartwatch by ¡°summer 2014,¡± and didn¡¯t launch it until early September, it would seem that OEMs are pretty loose about their definitions for launch windows. ¡°Early 2015¡± is simply anything before the very last day in June. And barring any major disasters, we should start to see Apple Watches on consumers¡¯ wrists long before then.

The main question, though, is what cool stuff will the competition cook up between then and now¡¦"

Judd Nelson doesn¡¯t even live in a Los Angeles condo located in a 31-story West Hollywood high-rise building. That little detail was fabricated along with the news of his death.

727,"The TV streaming services market may be on the verge of the biggest change yet given reports HBO and Apple may be talking about an exclusive partnership that would leave Netflix, Amazon and every other market player scrambling to make similar moves to grow subscription base and push TV boxes and sticks into consumer hands.

The news comes as HBO puts the finishing touches on its impending HBO Now standalone streaming service, built and designed by Major League Baseball Advanced Media, which is scheduled to debut by April 12.

Currently HBO subscribers typically pay for the channel's programming and service through a cable, telecomm or satellite provider, paying either a set standalone monthly fee or as part of a content bundle package.

With HBO Now, however, consumers will be able to subscribe directly from HBO for a $15 monthly fee. Reports say Time Warner, which owns HBO, is aiming to build a network of distributors to push the HBO Now service to the 10 million broadband households that are not subscribed to a cable TV bundle service, and the 70 million cable TV subscribers who aren't HBO subscribers.

Pulling Apple TV on as a partner would be a huge win-win given Apple's computing ecosystem and the access to Apple smartphone consumers.

For Apple, landing HBO Now for its fledgling Apple TV would be a major coup and compliment HBO Go, a mobile streaming service, already available via Apple TV since 2013.

HBO's subscriber price for HBO Now, however, may prove a sticky point as entrenched competitor Netflix has kept its prices at nearly half that cost. There's also the potential of exhausting consumers with fees given they're already laying out money for the Web TV boxes and sticks. While these costs are typically much less than a cable subscription the increasing number of standalone services could prove to be confusing and ultimately more expensive at some point.

It's clear, however, that HBO believes the HBO Now cost is appropriate and isn't about the change the reported pricing of $15 a month.

""""It's a premium product, and it will be priced accordingly,"""" HBO CEO Richard Plepler said during an earnings call last month.

Obviously some Time Warner shareholders like the idea of HBO and Apple partnering as shares rallied end of day Wednesday on the reports though ultimately ended flat.

At this point HBO is not providing details regarding the Apple partnership report, and Apple has declined to comment.

 """"We know there's great anticipation around our standalone streaming service,"""" an HBO spokesman said in a statement. """"And when we have details to share, we will do so.""""

Another compelling aspect for Apple striving to be the sole HBO Now partner is the fact that HBO produces """"Games of Thrones,"""" one of the most popular streaming content programs to date. The arrival of HBO Now is expected to debut with the fifth season's premiere.

Yet streaming content competitors' programs have been pulling in strong viewer support as well. Netflix's """"House of Cards"""" series is extremely popular and Amazon's original content program, """"Transparent,"""" has won an Emmy award."

Christian Bale will not be Steve Jobs after all.

Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that the actor has fallen off the Jobs biopic that is being directed by Danny Boyle.

The Sony project, which has a script by Aaron Sorkin and is being produced by Scott Rudin, Guymon Casady and Mark Gordon, was on track to begin shooting this winter for a quick turnaround.

Boyle is due in town this week to meet with actors and actresses for the movie. Seth Rogen is in discussions to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, but no official offer has been made. It is unclear how Bale¡¯s departure will affect casting.

Sources say Bale, after much deliberation and conflicting feelings, came to the conclusion he was not right for the part and decided to withdraw. The script is said to be divided into three acts that detail Jobs preparing for three presentations that came to define his life and the life of the company he co-founded, lost and came back to.

On Oct. 23, Sorkin told Bloomberg TV that Bale was playing Jobs. """"We needed the best actor on the board in a certain age range and that¡¯s Chris Bale,"""" the writer said at the time. """"He didn¡¯t have to audition. Well, there was a meeting.""""

Bale marks the second high-profile actor to receive an offer from Sony for the Jobs role but eventually pass. Leonardo DiCaprio also was in line for the late tech icon before moving on to shoot The Revenant. Neither had begun negotiations.

730,"Glenn Beck on Wednesday expressed fear that the 11 jets reportedly seized by radical Islamist groups in Libya over the past month could be used to cause extraordinary damage to the United States, even if the jets never leave the Middle East.

How? Extremists could crash the planes into the oil fields in any of the oil-rich countries on which the U.S. is dependent.
Beck was speaking with Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.) about the jets when Bachmann remarked: ¡°There¡¯s really two concerns. One, the planes could be used in a similar way that they were used on 9/11 in the United States. They could be used as, essentially, flying bombs ? into oil fields, buildings or strategic targets. Number two, [a] plane could be loaded with terrorists, could land as a commercial aircraft in an American city somewhere, or a European city. [They could] deplane, go about, carry out maybe a Mumbai-type disaster. So there¡¯s multiple ways these planes could be used.¡±

¡°Oil fields,¡± Beck repeated. ¡°The thing you said that feels the most true to me is the oil fields. ¡¦ We¡¯ll know what airplane ? that¡¯s one of those missing airplanes ? but you could take off in Libya and be over the skies of Saudi Arabia in lightning speed, and just crash it.¡±

Bachmann said that with some routes, if a flight to Saudi Arabia deviates from its course, the Saudis only have 90 seconds to neutralize the threat before it could cause tremendous harm.

¡°It¡¯s very little time that they have,¡± she said.

Talking to NBC News, a senior Iraqi official confirmed the deaths on Thursday. The strike on the ISIS stronghold of Mosul killed Abu Hajar al-Sufi, an aide to al-Baghdadi, as well as an explosives operative and the military leader of nearby Tal Afar, the source said. Al Arabiya cited the Iraqi Defence Ministry as saying that Baghdadi¡¯s aide had been killed.
Pentagon Spokesman Col Steve Warren could not confirm the deaths and said ISIS leaders had not been targeted. But he added that if ISIS leaders were embedded ¡°inside troop formations they are likely to be killed¡±.

732,"A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric has whipped up controversy by issuing a religious edict forbidding the building of snowmen, describingt them as anti-Islamic.

Asked on a religious website if it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for their children after a snowstorm in the country¡¯s north, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid replied: ¡°It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.¡±

Quoting from Muslim scholars, Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, an action considered sinful under the kingdom¡¯s strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.

¡°God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,¡± he wrote in his ruling.

That provoked swift responses from Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names.

¡°They are afraid for their faith of everything ... sick minds,¡± one Twitter user wrote.

Another posted a photo of a man in formal Arab garb holding the arm of a ¡°snow bride¡± wearing a bra and lipstick. ¡°The reason for the ban is fear of sedition,¡± he wrote.

A third said the country was plagued by two types of people: ¡°A people looking for a fatwa [religious ruling] for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa.¡±

Munajjid had some supporters however. ¡°It (building snowmen) is imitating the infidels, it promotes lustiness and eroticism,¡± one wrote. ¡°May God preserve the scholars, for they enjoy sharp vision and recognise matters that even Satan does not think about.¡±

He and the other living founding members of legendary hard-rock band Led Zeppelin were about to ink an $800?million contract with Virgin Atlantic billionaire Richard Branson to play a reunion tour, but the iconic band¡¯s singer ripped the contract to shreds in the final moments, a report said.
Founding members Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones signed on immediately when the flamboyant investor offered the Rock and Roll Hall of Famers the staggering amount to perform just 35 tour dates in three locations including London, Berlin and New Jersey, according to the UK¡¯s Mirror.
But Branson was left stunned when the 66-year-old Plant tore the agreement to pieces right in front of the concert promoters, the newspaper said.
¡°There was an enormous sense of shock,¡± a source told the Mirror. ¡°He said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given.¡±
Guitarist Page and bassist Jones were all set to perform along with drummer Jason Bonham, who has filled in for his late father, John Bonham, in the past.
They gave their cranky frontman two days to think about the historic reunion, and he turned into a real heartbreaker for fans who have dreamed of another reunion tour.
¡°It was a no-brainer for them, but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it,¡± the source said. ¡°They have tried to talk him ¡¯round, but there is no chance. His mind is made up and that¡¯s that.¡±
And it¡¯s not likely that the band can hire a replacement for Plant¡¯s unique voice.
¡°There is no way they can go ahead without him,¡± the source said.
Branson, a tremendous fan of the ¡¯70s rock band, reportedly pulled out all the stops to get the ¡°The Song Remains the Same¡± rockers back on stage together.
The founder of Virgin Group was planning on renaming one of his jumbo jets ¡°The Starship¡± and having the craft ferry the stars around to their gigs.
He was even going to have the staircase of the jet renamed the Stairway to Heaven after the band¡¯s landmark hit.
¡°Even his money was not enough to get Plant to sign up,¡± the source said, adding that the tycoon was very upset by the singer¡¯s diss.
The band last played together, with Jason Bonham filling in on drums, during a tribute concert at London¡¯s O2 arena in 2007.

737,"Amazon.com announced plans for its first brick-and-mortar store, Dow Jones reported. It will open on 34th Street in Manhattan across the street from the Empire State Building, just in time for this year's holiday season.

The experimental pop-up store will function as a small warehouse, holding limited inventory for same-day deliveries only in New York. The store may also host tech showcases for items such as Kindle e-readers, Fire phones and Fire TVs.

A customer may order an item online and then pick it up that same day in the store.

Amazon stock was down 2 percent in midafternoon trading Thursday.

The company risks increasing costs related to retailing such as paying leases and hiring workers. But if the store is successful, it may set a precedent for additional stores in other cities.

Amazon has been researching and scouting a possible store for several years, said a person familiar with the project. Two years ago, the company went as far as scouting spots in Seattle, where it is headquartered.

""""Same-day delivery, ordering online and picking up in-store are ideas that are really catching on. Amazon needs to be at the center of that,"""" Matt Nemer, a Wells Fargo analyst, told Dow Jones.

Other companies such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot have already incorporated this order-online, pick-up in-store model. Clothing company Bonobos opened 10 stores in 2011 and plans to expand to 40 stores by 2016.

Amazon tried brick-and-mortar experiments before, such as Kindle vending machines that sold tablets and e-readers in malls."

Two Republican lawmakers told BuzzFeed News Wednesday suspected terrorists have infiltrated the U.S.?Mexico border and as many as 10 fighters have been captured, but Homeland Security officials deny any such thing has happened.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah, said four alleged terror suspects were captured on Sept. 10 in Texas. In an interview Wednesday, Chaffetz said the men flew from a Middle Eastern country to Mexico City, where they paid a smuggler to take them to and across the border. From there, the men ended up in a safe house for immigrants. They were en route to New York City, Chaffetz said, when they were captured.

Chaffetz would not reveal his source of the information, but said he confirmed it with government officials. ¡°I had an informant tell me about it and then I questioned the Secretary of Homeland Security,¡± he said. ¡°I have no doubt about its authenticity.¡±

The four alleged terror suspects had affiliations with groups other than the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Chaffetz said. He added that they were still being held in Texas as of Wednesday.

California Rep. Duncan Hunter, a Republican who represents San Diego County, made headlines Tuesday when he said to Fox News¡¯ Greta Van Susteren that he had ¡°asked Border Patrol¡± about terrorists and learned that several had been captured.

Hunter claimed 10 terror suspects had been caught near the border, including four people allegedly captured in September.

¡°I know at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,¡± he said on the program.

Hunter¡¯s spokesman Joe Kasper told BuzzFeed News the congressman¡¯s assertion that 10 terror suspects had been captured along the border included the same four people described by Chaffetz. Kasper claimed four other suspects had been captured within the last 36 hours, and pointed to a Judicial Watch story that allegedly ¡°confirmed¡± the most recent captures to back up his assertion.

Two additional suspects were picked up sometime after the first group in September, but before this week, Kasper said.

The Department of Homeland Security strongly denied Hunter¡¯s claim that terror suspects had been caught near the border.

When reached for comment, Customs and Border Protection referred BuzzFeed News to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which did not respond to emails Wednesday. However, DHS released an identical statement to both The New Republic and ABC News denying that there were terrorists coming across the border:

The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground. DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.

But Hunter isn¡¯t buying that explanation. His spokesman told BuzzFeed News Wednesday that they have evidence from reliable sources about ¡°foreign nationals¡± being captured along the border. Kasper said those foreign nationals may not technically be ISIS fighters, but do have suspected terror group affiliations. Kasper did not identify his sources but said that Hunter¡¯s office remains convinced that the lawmaker was correct.

The issue of terrorists coming over the U.S.?Mexico border has been a contentious and increasingly politicized one.

Among the other claims about terrorists using the border to enter the country, Rep. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, said ISIS may be teaming up with Mexican drug cartels. Audio recorded at a town hall apparently showed Cotton saying that ISIS could potentially attack people in Arkansas, the Washington Post reported Tuesday.

Cotton did not respond to BuzzFeed News¡¯ request for comment Wednesday, but when the Post asked about the statements his spokesman pointed to a series of conservative websites. And like many of the claims about the border and terrorism, the story goes back months and relies on sources who are not named ? making it difficult to verify."
743,"Shocking video taken from inside an Afghanistan war zone reveals a Marine's unbelievable brush with death when a Taliban sniper's bullet hits him directly in the head as a fellow soldier's helmet cam catches it all.

The soldier survived to fight again following the 2013 insurgent ambush in the Now Zad District of Helmand Province thanks to his Kevlar-reinforced helmet.

It's a terrifying first-hand look at how close U.S. forces come to disaster each day as wars rage abroad.

Shocking video: A group of Marines fighting in the Now Zad District of Helmand Province in Afghanistan were ambushed by insurgents when a sniper's bullet struck one of them directly in the helmet. Video captured the shocking moment. From right to left, the group are seen leaving a desert building when the bullet hits the helmet (center and left) and lefts up a piece of fabric on the Kevlar reinforced helmet

Minor damage: The Marines run back to safety and the piece of fabric can clearly be seen missing from the Marine's helmet

'A Taliban sniper managed to get a non-fatal headshot on a Marine's helmet while the Marines were conducting a joint helicopter raid in the Now Zad district,' wrote Sam Arnold, who uploaded the video to YouTube.

According to Arnold, the sniper shot was part of a 'U-shaped ambush by insurgents.'

The video starts as three Marines prepare to leave the protection of the ruins of a desert building. Just before they leave, the bullet hits.

Ringing in the ears: The Marine suffered some ringing in the ears but was otherwise okay following his brush with death

The struck Marine can clearly be seen falling back after the bullet hits him and all three men quickly retreat to safety.

'You lucky son of a b****,' one of the Marines marvels.

The men all inspect the helmet that saved him and the only evidence it shows of the impact is a missing piece of cloth.

The Marine himself says he's fine, too, minus some ringing in the ears, before the group all moves on to fight other battles.

744,"If North Korea's Supreme Leader, Kim Jong-un, is not running the Hermit Kingdom, then who is?

That presumes, of course, that the 30-something leader has run into serious health problems, physical or political, and no one yet knows that for sure -- only that he has remained out of public view for five weeks.

But in the opaque world of North Korean politics, that's enough to start a serious guessing game.

While North Korean officials quietly let the word filter out this week that Kim is doing just fine with an injured ankle, that hasn't quelled speculation on who might grasp the reins of power if they slip -- or have slipped -- from his chubby hands.

There are only a handful of possible pretenders to the throne, but perhaps the most intriguing is 27-year-old Kim Yo Jong, who wields the ultimate trump card as youngest daughter of the late departed leader Kim Jong Il and granddaughter of the founder of the country, Kim Il Sung.

A think-tank operated by North Korean defectors, the North Korea Intellectuals' Solidarity, says she may be directing the government, at least temporarily.

As with most top figures in North Korea, particularly members of the Kim family, little is known of Kim Yo Jong, and much of that is a compilation of snippets of information.

One of the most extensive bios comes from Michael Madden, who runs the blog North Korea Leadership Watch. He says Kim Yo Jong was been identified in the North Korean media as deputy director of the Workers' Party of Korea, a powerful position indeed.

It was the first explicit mention of her in a state media report as a senior party official -- and a sign of her ascension.

Madden also says she works as an aide to her brother, Kim Jong-un -- something of a chief of staff -- running his public events, itineraries and logistical needs. In addition, she has ties to the Guard Command and Ministry of State Security.

Her biggest foray to the West came as a child when she attended elementary school in Berne, Switzerland from 1996 to 2000, using the name """"Kim Yo'ng Sun"""" and living in the North Korean Embassy. Her brother, now Supreme Leader, was also studying nearby. Madden says that some photos of her as child were captured on home video by other parents at the school.

Kim Yo Jong has made periodic appearances in public, notably in December 2011 at various events held for her deceased father, Kim Jong Il. She has also been shown in the North Korean media in the background while her brother visits hospitals or children's camps, and can be seen sitting in the elite arm chair section reserved for high officials, though on the second row, at a concert attended by her brother.

Madden also says he believes she played a large role in planning Hwang's recent trip to South Korea, raising speculation as to which of these powerful figures had the upper hand in pulling it off.

""""She is one of the only people in [North Korea] that we know has unfettered direct access to (Kim Jong Un),"""" Madden tells Global Post. """"At the present time I would not be surprised if she is sole gatekeeper.""""

Victor Cha, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who handled the North Korea portfolio with the National Security Council, tells CNN that if Kim Yo Jong, at age 27, is in fact running the country """"it means there is something seriously wrong with Kim Jong Un and there is some sort of void that they're desperately trying to fill.""""

Among those already wielding power is Hwang Pyong So, who has moved up quickly under Kim Jong Un as vice marshall of the Korean People's Army and new chief of the General Political Bureau of the KPA.

Most important, he is vice-director of the Organization and Guidance Department for the Workers Party of Korea, a post that finalizes appointments within North Korea's leadership.

Hwang's rapid rise makes him chief beneficiary of a series of recent high-level military purges, including the arrest and execution of the Supreme Leader's uncle, Jang Song Theak, a four-star general.

Last weekend, Hwang, who is believed to be around 65 years old, led a North Korean delegation on a surprise visit to South Korea, ostensibly to visit the Asian Games, where North Korean athletes were participating. The delegation reportedly gave the South Koreans only one day's notice.

Hwang, decked out in his high-peaked cap, also held closed-door talks with top South Korean officials and agreed to restart long-stalled peace talks between the two countries, which are still technically at war.

Hwang's position atop the military structure offers considerable clout in a highly structured, tightly controlled North Korea and makes him a prime contender for the top spot.

Of course, in a secretive world like North Korea, powerful figures may well operate out of the shadows. One clue to the pecking order, though, is a favorite of old Cold War Kremlinologists -- seeing who sits next to whom at public events.

One well-placed figure, literally and figuratively, has been Gen. O Kum Chol, who was shown in July sitting two seats away from Kim Jong-un at a volleyball game.

As Vice Chief of the KPA General Staff, O Kum Chol's portfolio includes military strategy and planning as well as relations with foreign militaries. He is also a member of the central committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and deputy of the Supreme People's Assembly, which gives him considerable clout.

On the other hand, the guy sitting between him and Kim Jong Un was none other than Hwang Pyong So.

Until Kim Jong Un's status is clarified, the speculation will continue."

754,"A statement attributed to the Islamic State group claimed that an American female hostage was killed in a Jordanian airstrike on Friday on the outskirts of the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, the extremist group¡¯s main stronghold.

Jordan launches new airstrikes after vowing harsh war on ISIS

Dozens of Jordanian fighter jets bombed ISIS training centers and weapons storage sites Thursday, intensifying attacks after the militants burned to death a captured Jordanian pilot.

As part of the new campaign, Jordan is also attacking targets in Iraq, said Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh. Up to now, Jordan had struck ISIS targets in Syria, but not Iraq, as part of a U.S.-led military coalition.
The statement identified the woman as Kayla Jean Mueller and said she was killed during Muslim prayers ? which usually take place around midday on Fridays ? in airstrikes that targeted ¡°the same location for more than an hour.¡±

No Islamic State militants were killed in the airstrikes, the statement further claimed. It published photos allegedly of the bombed site, showing a severely damaged brown colored three-story building ? but no images of Mueller.

American officials said they were looking into the report. Bernadette Meehan, the spokeswoman for President Barack Obama¡¯s National Security Council, said the White House has ¡°not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates¡± the claim.


¡°We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports,¡± she added.

White House spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters travelling with the president to Indiana Friday that the U.S. does co-ordinate with the Jordanian air force as they fly airstrikes. He wouldn¡¯t say whether the U.S. was aware of the hostage¡¯s location.

Jordanian government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani said Jordan was looking into the claim.

¡°But as a first reaction, we think it¡¯s illogical and we are highly skeptical about it,¡± he said. ¡°How could they identify a Jordanian warplane ¡¦ in the sky? What was the American lady doing in a weapons warehouse?¡±

¡°For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,¡± she said. ¡°It¡¯s important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.¡±

According to the local paper, Mueller had been working with the humanitarian aid agency Support to Life, as well as a local NGO that helped female Syrian refugees develop skills.


A 2007 article about Mueller from the same local newspaper said she was a student at Northern Arizona University and was active in the Save Darfur Coalition.

On Sunday, Obama said the U.S. was ¡°deploying all the assets that we can¡± to find Mueller.

¡°We are in very close contact with the family trying to keep them updated,¡± he said in an interview with NBC¡¯s Today Show. ¡°Obviously this is something that is heart-breaking for the family and we want to make sure we do anything we can to make sure that any American citizen is rescued from this situation.¡±

Mueller¡¯s identity had not been disclosed until now out of fears for her safety.

If her death is confirmed, she would be the fourth American to die while in the captivity of the Islamic State militants. Three other Americans, journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig were beheaded by the group.

Jordan, which is part of a U.S.-led coalition bombing Islamic State group targets in Syria, stepped up its attacks after the Islamic State announced it had killed a captive Jordanian pilot. The Syrian government said Thursday that dozens of Jordanian fighter jets had bombed Islamic State training centres and weapons storage sites. It did not say where the attacks occurred.

The Jordanian military said that Jordanian jetfighters carried out ¡°a series of attacks today and destroyed the targets and returned safely.¡± It did not elaborate or give a location for the airstrikes.

But activists who monitor the Syrian conflict from inside the country said U.S.-led coalition planes hit several targets on the edges and outskirts of Raqqa, in quick succession on Friday.

A collective known as ¡°Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently¡± said the planes targeted multiple Islamic State positions and headquarters in the western and eastern countryside of Raqqa, sending columns of smoke into the sky. Explosions could be heard in the city. The collective said there were no recorded civilian casualties, and did not mention Islamic State casualties.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said dozens of Islamic State members were killed in coalition airstrikes that targeted a tanks-and-vehicles depot in the area of al-Madajen and at least six other Islamic State positions, including a training camp and a prison.

755,"Less than two weeks after Aaron Sorkin said that Christian Bale would play Steve Jobs in the screenwriter's forthcoming biopic about the late Apple co-founder, Bale has dropped from the project. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Bale """"came to the conclusion he was not right for the part and decided to withdraw"""" before negotiations began. Sony, the studio releasing the film, had no comment on the THR report when contacted by HuffPost Entertainment.

Bale becomes the second high-profile star to bail on Sorkin's film within the last month. Back in October, Leonardo DiCaprio, who had been in talks to play Jobs, pulled himself out of consideration as well.

""""We needed the best actor on the board in a certain age range and that¡¯s Chris Bale,"""" Sorkin said to Bloomberg Television in a recent interview when asked about the Jobs role. """"He really is a phenomenal actor.""""

It's unclear who will replace Bale as the lead of the film, but other actors once rumored included Bradley Cooper, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. Last week, it was also reported that Seth Rogen was in talks to play Steve Wozniak, but that casting has not been confirmed at this time.

Danny Boyle, meanwhile, is still set to direct the film. He replaced David Fincher, who was initially attached to the project. When Fincher departed back in April, THR noted that he had wanted Bale to play the lead role as well.

756,"Gill Rosenberg, the Canadian Israeli volunteer fighting with Kurdish forces, posted on Facebook on Monday night that she was """"safe and secure"""" and not captured by ISIS guerillas, as had been widely reported in the media. has apparently not been captured by the Islamic State, as widely reported in the media.

""""Guy, I'm totally safe and secure. I don't have Internet access or any communication devices with me for my safety and security,"""" the post continued. """"I can't reply regularly and only happened to have a chance to log in and see these bullshit news stories. Ignore the reports I've been captured. Yalla, Acharai [after me]!"""" 

Haaretz was unable to verify that Rosenberg herself was responsible for the post.



A second post uploaded to Rosenberg's Facebook page half an hour later read: """"All: On Behalf of Gill Rosenberg - please be advised that she is safe and sound. DO NOT listen to the reports for the past few days about kidnapping. I will update you again when I hear from her. Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers!! Thank you!""""

Several Islamist blogs and websites reported last week that Rosenberg
had been captured by ISIS.

A blog considered to be one of the Islamic State's media arms reported that several female fighters who fought alongside the Kurds have been captured, among them Rosenberg. According to the report, prior to their capture Islamic State fighters made three suicide bombing attacks against Kurdish outposts, killing some and capturing many others.

Kurdish sources denied the reports, saying that Rosenberg wasn't in the area when it was attacked.

In her previous Facebook post on November 20, Rosenberg wrote that she would be without internet access for at least two weeks.

""""My Facebook account and friend requests are being managed by someone else until I have access again in apx 2 weeks time on or around week of 12/8,"""" she wrote at the time. """"Please do not message as this is not me. Thank you.""""

Rosenberg, 31, a resident of Tel Aviv, joined the Kurdish troops against Islamic State in northern Syria earlier this month. According to reports, Rosenberg said she had contacted Kurdish fighters over the
Internet before traveling through Iraq to train at one of their camps on the Syrian border.

According to Walla, Rosenberg immigrated to Israel from Canada in 2006, leaving behind a career as a civilian pilot, and served for two years in the Israel Defense Forces. In 2009, she was extradited to the United States and jailed over an international phone scam, one of her former lawyers said.

Israel Radio aired an interview with Rosenberg earlier in November in which she said she had travelled to Iraq, was training with Kurdish guerrillas and would fight in neighboring Syria.

""""They are our brothers. They are good people. They love life, a lot like us, really,"""" she told Israel Radio, explaining her decision to enter the combat zone in northern Syria."
757,"PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. -- A journeyman professional golfer who has spent time recently giving lessons and caddying said in a radio interview that Tiger Woods has been suspended for a month by the PGA Tour -- a claim that the PGA Tour and Woods' agent vehemently deny.

Dan Olsen, 48, who last played a PGA Tour event at the 2011 PGA Championship, told 730AM The Game in Lansing, Mich., on Friday that """"I heard he's on a month's suspension ... it's kind of a strong witness. It's a credible person who is telling me this.''

[+] EnlargeTiger Woods

Both the PGA Tour and Tiger Woods' agent have emphatically denied claims that he has been suspended for a month by the Tour.
Olsen, who played only one full season on the PGA Tour (2004), said an exempt tour player told him, but he would not disclose the player and couldn't say he fully believed him. He also told ESPN.com's Michael Collins on Monday that the information he got about the suspension was not first-hand.

""""It's not testosterone, but it's something else,'' Olsen said. """"I think when it's all said and done, he's gonna surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy.''

Olsen also talked about Woods using a """"cheater ball,'' referring to the Nike golf ball he plays, and that those allegations were potentially more damaging than the suspension.

""""I'll be looked at as just some crazy f--- nobody making accusations about Tiger,'' Olsen told ESPN.com.

Ty Votaw, the executive vice president of the PGA Tour, denied any of the claims brought forth by Olsen. 

""""There is no truth whatsoever to these claims,"""" Votaw said. """"We categorically deny these allegations.''

The Tour almost never comments on disciplinary matters.

Woods said on Feb. 11 that he was taking a break to deal with the issues in his game after withdrawing during the first round last month of the Farmers Insurance Open.

""""Over the past year, Woods has withdrawn with an injury three times and now fallen outside of the 70 in the world.

""""These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,'' said Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, in a statement. """"They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous. The PGA Tour has confirmed that there is no truth to these claims.''

If Woods failed a test for performance drugs, the PGA Tour has said it is required to announce a suspension. And it would undoubtedly be for more than a month. If he failed a test for some sort of recreational substance, the tour's policy is not to disclose any penalties.

But if the transgression were severe, a month penalty would seem minor.

""""They're not even going to remember the women,'' Olsen said, referring to the personal scandal Woods endured in 2009 which led to a divorce from his wife. """"The women are going to take a distance second place. You're gonna talk about him with Lance Armstrong.''

The PGA Tour began testing for performance enhancing drugs in 2008 and Woods has been randomly tested like other players. Only two players have run afoul of the drug testing guidelines and both were suspended for a year.

Olsen tied for 12th at Tucson in 2004, one of only eight cuts that he made in 31 PGA Tour starts that season. He also played the Web.com Tour in 2006, finishing with two top-10s in 27 events."

Breaking News: Macaulay Culkin Found Dead at Age 34

Origins: On 6 November 2014, an online rumor claimed actor Macaulay Culkin, best known for his roles in the 1990s Home Alone films, had died. That rumor was based on a Facebook hoax memorial page set up for the star:

At about 11 a.m. ET on Thursday (November 06, 2014), our beloved actor Macaulay Culkin passed away.

Macaulay Culkin was born on August 26, 1980 in New York. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.

The Facebook page memorializing the still-living star was soon taken down, but not before hundreds of thousands of social network users were duped by its claims. Culkin was photographed after the rumor began to circulate, alive and in the company of his bandmates:

760,"Let's face it: Many of us hesitate to hand money to the homeless, concerned they will spend it in ways we'd consider unwise. 


But one man put that belief to the test ... and his surprising new video showing what happened after he gave a homeless man $100 has already racked up over 10 million views on YouTube.

Josh Paler Lin, whose YouTube channel has more than 711,000 subscribers and usually features pranks, thought he'd try a social experiment: Give a homeless man money, then follow him in secret to see what he'd do with it.

And sure enough, the man's first stop was at a liquor store. He emerged with a bag and took it to a nearby park. Well, what do you expect, right?

Wrong: Once at the park, the man pulled food from the bag and shared it with his fellow homeless.

""""My heart was crushed,"""" Lin told TODAY.


After witnessing what the homeless man, whose name is Thomas, did with the cash, Lin approached him on camera and explained that he'd been following him. He apologized and gave Thomas more money.

Thomas said that he'd quit his job to take care of his sick parents, then lost his family home after they died. He said he's been on the street for four months.

Lin decided to take action, setting up a crowdfunding page to raise money to help Thomas get off the streets. Donations thus far have topped $50,000. 

""""People think I changed his life,"""" said Lin, who maintains the video was not staged. """"For me, it's completely the opposite. I feel that he changed my life.""""

761,"SYDNEY - An Australian man had a spider removed from his stomach after it burrowed its way into his body and survived for three days before being removed.

Dylan Maxwell was on holidays on the Indonesian island of Bali when the tiny creature borrowed through a small appendix scar and traveled up his torso, leaving a red scar-like trail from his navel to his chest.

Lifting his shirt, Maxwell told an Australian television network """"that's where it actually borrowed underneath my skin"""".

While still in Bali, Maxwell visited a local medical centre and was prescribed an antihistamine for an insect bite.

""""Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that's been living inside me for the last three days,"""" Maxwell posted on his Facebook page where he goes by the name of Dylan Thomas.

""""Haven't felt so violated in my life before! Just glad it's all over"""", he said.

After returning to Australia earlier this week, doctors removed the tropical visitor.

""""They managed to pull the spider out of my navel and put it in a specimen jar and took it away,"""" said Maxwell, whose mates have nicknamed him """"Spiderman""""."
763,"Following reports of Islamic State militants using chlorine gas to attack Iraqi security officials in Duluiyah, the United States has ordered a probe into the matter.
The National Security Council is reportedly in touch with Iraqi officials to gather more information into the chemical attack.
According to a Washington Post report, on 15 September at 4:20 pm, 11 Iraqi police officers were rushed into the hospital emergency room in Balad. """"Some struggled to stand; tears streamed from their eyes,"""" the report noted.
The attack took place at Duluiyah where the security personnel, members of the Sunni Jabbour tribe, were guarding a line in the north of the city.
After an exchange of fire, according to a survivor's account, the security personnel there were surprised to see ISIS fighters withdrawing from their position. And soon after that an explosion took place.
""""It was a strange explosion. We saw a yellow smoke in the sky,"""" Lt. Khairalla al-Jabbouri, 31, said. The wind carried the fog toward their lines. """"I felt suffocated,"""" al-Jabbouri said. """"I was throwing up and couldn't breathe.""""
In an official statement, the Iraqi defence ministry also confirmed that ISIS had used chlorine gas against its forces. The statement, however, undermined the attack and said the ISIS used chlorine in a """"primitive and ineffective way"""".
?
Back in June, after ISIS captured Al Muthanna facility -- where former Iraq former leader Saddam Hussein stored his chemical weapons -- it was feared that the Islamic State militants may carry out chemical attacks.
The use of crude bombs made using Chlorine only proves the extend the terror outfit is ready to go. """"We continue to take all allegations of chemical weapon use ? and in particular these recent allegations regarding the use of chlorine as a chemical weapon ? very seriously,"""" spokesman for the National Security Council, Alistair Baskey told The New York Times.
""""We are aware of the reports but cannot confirm details and are seeking additional information. The use of chlorine as a chemical weapon is an abhorrent act. These recent allegations underscore the importance of our work to eliminate chemical weapons in this volatile region,"""" Baskey added.
The reports of ISIS' chlorine attack in Iraq comes at time when reports claimed earlier last week that the Islamic State militants used mustard gas on Kurdish fighters in Kobane.
The Middle-East Review of International Affairs (MERIA Journal) even released a trove of photographs as 'proof' of ISIS using chemical weapons."
767,"Nasa has raised doubts about whether a loud boom and a gaping crater found in Nicaragua this weekend were caused by a meteorite, as the government has said.

Nasa said that while a meteorite cannot be ruled out, the lack so far of any eyewitness accounts of a fireball lighting up the nighttime sky outside the capital, Managua, suggest something else was behind the event.

Photos showed a crater about 39ft wide in a wooded area near Managua's international airport.

The head of Nasa's Meteoroid Environment Office, Bill Cooke, estimated that it would have been created by a blast of roughly the energy equivalent of 1 tonne of TNT.

Nasa said in a statement that a meteor capable of that would have created a ball of flame visible over a wide area. About 1.5 million people live in the Nicaraguan capital.

Cooke said: """"For something to produce a hole in the ground that big, it would have generated a very bright fireball. And nothing was reported ¡¦ despite the population. So I'm very sceptical.""""

There was no word so far of any meteorite fragments being found in the crater.

Rosario Murillo, a government spokeswoman and wife of the president, Daniel Ortega, said on Sunday that a relatively small meteorite was responsible for the phenomenon. The following afternoon she said scientists from other countries had expressed interest in coming to investigate.

Jaime Incer, a scientist who advises the Nicaraguan presidency on environmental matters, said he could not confirm for sure it was a meteorite, but said that """"among the possibilities, it's one of the most likely"""". He said he suspects a meteorite composed of rock.

Incer said it is possible nobody was looking up at the heavens when the event took place late at night. Residents described it as a loud boom.

""""I was walking back home after playing billiards, and suddenly I heard the explosion and felt the shockwave, which was very strong,"""" said Victor Gutierrez, a 38-year-old mechanic who lives less than a mile from the site of the crater. """"I didn't see anything in the sky either before or after.""""

Incer and Lindley Johnson, an executive for Nasa's Near-Earth Object Observations Program, agreed that whatever happened in Nicaragua had nothing to do with an asteroid that flew past Earth this weekend.

At the time of the explosion, the object known as 2014 RC was about as far away as the moon, Johnson said. 2014 RC's passage close to the planet happened about 13 hours later.

Cooke said there could be any number of alternative explanations, ranging from ordinance to """"someone out blowing things up""""."
769,"The baby in the popular children's TV show Teletubbies has finally revaled herself as a university student.

Jess Smith, 19, was just nine months old when she became one of the most familiar faces on British television in March 1997.

As the BBC prepares to make 60 new episodes of the Teletubbies, the laughing tot in the sun, who featured in all 365 episodes, has now revealed herself.

Jess was selected to overlook Teletubbyland as Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po had fun below.

Her decision to come out and 'say hello' came after her first week at Canterbury Christ Church university, when students were told to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.

After holding back due to shyness, she eventually said: """"I thought I may as well tell them as I'm going to be spending the next three years with them.""""

Jess, a first-year dance education student, then broke the news on Facebook.

She posted: """"So I've recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I've decided it's time to tell everyone.

""""I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I've gained the confidence to come out with it.

""""I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be 'the sun' but only I could tell you the real story.""""

The 19-year-old broke the news on Facebook (SWNS.com)

In 1996, her mother, Anji Smith, 44, took her to Edenbridge Hospital to be weighed and a health visitor, who had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies, put Jess's name forward.

Mrs Smith said it was never intended to be a big thing: """"It was just something a bit different to do and we didn't expect it to be as big as it was.

""""They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad.

""""We didn't hear anything until we got a letter when she was 18 months old saying she'd been picked.

""""It was really weird seeing her on television.""""

Jess was put in a high chair for the filming so she would be looking down like the sun.

Her furniture deliverer father Bill, 49, made her giggle by playing with a teddy bear behind the camera.

And as no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just ?250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home."

Correction: This post originally presented the video of a bird pooping on Putin as real, but comparison with Russian news footage from the event shows it to be a hoax. Putin¡¯s unintentionally ironic speech decrying ¡°excessive ambitions in war,¡± though, was very real.

Right here is where a media critic generally hammers the offender for naivete, stupidity and a failure to observe reportorial protocol. All of which applies to this instance, but hey, that fake pooping video looks pretty convincing, in part because the white blotch falls not on Putin¡¯s dome ? an obvious landing spot for a hoaxster ? but on his left shoulder.

The Post¡¯s ¡°Know More¡± blog also fell for it. That post is now titled ¡°Vladimir Putin gives speech on dangers of military aggression.¡± Its URL reads, ¡°bird-defecates-on-vladimir-putin-during-speech-video.¡± It, too, has apprised readers that it got taken: ¡°Correction: A bird did not defecate on Russian President Vladimir Putin during a speech on Friday.

The former prisoner, being held in Qatar, is believed to have tried to make contact with Taliban associates in Afghanistan, officials told CNN.

NBC News reported that it¡¯s unknown whether the man actually connected with the Taliban or if it was a true effort to actually rejoin militants. The name of the former detainee has not been disclosed.

From CNN:

[A]n ongoing U.S. intelligence program to secretly intercept and monitor all of their communications in Qatar turned up evidence in recent months that one of them has ¡°reached out¡± to try to encourage militant activity, one official said. The official would offer no further details.

Under current law, this act placed the man in the category of being ¡°suspected¡± of re-engaging in terrorist or insurgent activities. However, several officials say there is now a debate inside the administration that the intelligence may be stronger than the ¡°suspected¡± classification. Some elements of the intelligence community believe the information is strong enough to classify the man as ¡°confirmed¡± for returning to illegal activities. All five men are having their communications even more closely monitored right now, but the belief is there is no current threat, one official told CNN.

¡°We¡¯re closely monitoring the situation and see no potential threat,¡± an official told NBC.

The prisoner swap, which occurred in May, drew ire from lawmakers who said the Obama administration broke federal law by not first informing Congress.

Bergdahl was back in the news this week with reports that the Army was preparing to charge him with desertion after he disappeared from his Afghanistan post in 2009 and was held in captivity for five years. The Army denied that any decision on charges had been made."

According to a British military expert who has just returned from Iraq, ISIS has improvised a new weapon by putting live scorpions inside bomb canisters. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former British army and NATO head of chemical and biological weapons revealed that ISIS has thought of a new way to spread terror. He described it as """"madness"""" and said ISIS promotes the use of scorpion bombs to create panic.

De Bretton-Gordon explained that scorpions are """"robust"""" as the creatures can survive the impact of a launch even from a couple of miles. When the canisters break, thousands of scorpions will """"start crawling all around,"""" the Mirror reported. Although not all scorpions are poisonous, the military expert said ISIS mainly wants to incite fear. The 2-ft scorpion bombs are not meant for mass casualties but are devised for maximum """"psychological impact.""""

De Bretton-Gordon had returned from Baghdad last week where he took an advisory role to train Iraqi forces fighting ISIS militants. Senior officials in Iraq have reported that the scorpions were being used against civilian targets in the northern part of the country. Officials said the use of scorpions as weapons dates back to 198 AD when the creatures were stuffed into pots and thrown to enemies.

Meanwhile, ISIS militants in Mosul are preparing for an attack from the Iraqi government forces as they cut off telephone lines and imposed a ban on residents to leave the city. The Daily Telegraph was told that conditions in the city have deteriorated since ISIS is under constant pressure to fight back Iraqi ground troops.

A resident in Mosul revealed ISIS has imposed a rule that residents have to follow or else face punishment. The militants have warned residents to secure a guarantor if they wish to leave the city and come back after a few days. The Mosul resident, who asked not to be named, said people in the Iraqi city are trying to leave. Hospitals have shut down operations since there is no water or electricity.

U.S.-led coalition forces continue to launch airstrikes on ISIS targets as President Barack Obama has vowed that there will be """"no safe haven"""" for ISIS.

State prosecutors in the country said a man they arrested told how 17 of the missing youths were rounded up and killed, then thrown in pits, where badly charred remains have now been unearthed.

Authorities said that the man told them how the students, who went missing after a violent clash on September 26, were marched to the site on the outskirts of Iguala, Guerrero state before their deaths.

Hunt: A forensic investigator works at the site of the mass graves, near Iguala in Mexico

The bodies found by authorities are so damaged that they could not be identified. All that is left are bones and small pieces of flesh.

Investigators found 28 bodies there, though local officials say as many as 34 were buried across six separate pits.

It could be days before the identities of the dead are known for sure.

Security officials said earlier they believed the victims had been driven to the end of the track, walked up the hillside, executed and buried in six graves.

As investigators worked at the site, up to 2,000 protesters blocked a main highway in the Guerrero state capital of Chilpancingo demanding justice.

'You took them alive, we want them returned alive,' read a huge banner hung across the road linking Mexico City and Acapulco.

Victims: The above poster shows the 43 missing students and offers a reward for their recovery

Mass grave: The roughly 30 bodies in the grave are believed to belong the group of 43 missing students

Jesus Lopez, an Acapulco street vendor whose 19-year-old son Giovani is among the missing, said he hoped the remains weren't those of the students.

Other relatives 'told us that (the remains) were burned, and that they couldn't be the kids,' Lopez said. 'But we're really nervous.'

Mexico's National Human Rights Commission opened its own investigation into the case for possible 'serious human rights abuses,' such as extrajudicial executions and forced disappearances by Iguala city police.

Police infiltrated by local drug cartels are suspected of abducting some of the students, a local security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

One security official said: 'You really can't call them police'.

He added that suspected gang members had told investigators that police had handed over the students to the people who killed them, who belonged to the gang.

Suspicion: Masked police officers stand guard atop a vehicle outside of the morgue in Iguala

Forensic workers arrive at the morgue: Relatives of the missing have given DNA samples for identification

Grim work: The remains of nine people had been brought from the hillside so far, with another 25 to follow

Heartbroken: Relatives and colleagues blockade a toll road near the site of the disappearance

Demonstration: Fellow students protested earlier this week over the dissapearance

The suspected gang members had also helped the authorities identify the site, the security official said.

Soldiers and police had cordoned off the dirt track where it ended not far from the graves, which lay about a 40-minute walk across rocky terrain inaccessible by vehicle.

The fatal clashes took place in Iguala on the night of September 26. Thirty people, including 22 police, have been arrested in connection with the violence, which claimed the lives of at least six people and left 25 injured.

Information leading to the discovery of the graves had in part come from the interrogation of local police arrested after the clashes in Iguala, the security official said.

Guerrero state, home to Iguala and the resort of Acapulco, has been one of the most lawless in the country for years.

Officials said the remains of nine people had been taken down from the hillside so far, with another 25 due to follow."

780,"As the secretive state¡¯s leader remains out of the public eye, analysts wonder if Kim Yo-jong has assumed the leadership

When Kim Yo-jong, was introduced to the public as a ¡°senior official of the party central committee¡± in March, analysts speculated that she could one day become North Korea¡¯s most powerful woman.

Now, as the country¡¯s leader remains conspicuously absent from public life, it has been suggested that Kim Jong-un¡¯s younger sister may have stepped up to help him manage the daily affairs of leadership while he battles a bout of ill health.

Along with Kim¡¯s wife, the former singer Ri Sol-ju, the 27-year-old is one of the country¡¯s most prominent women and has been photographed with her brother on public visits. However, it is her absence from the limelight that some believe adds weight to the theory that she may have taken over some, or even all, of the leadership responsibilities from her brother as he recovers from his ¡°physical discomfort¡±.

¡°If Kim has indeed been set aside ? and nobody outside Pyongyang really knows ? then whoever has taken power is not seeking the limelight,¡± said John Everard, former UK ambassador to Pyongyang.¡°The visits to factories and military units that Kim frequently conducted have not been taken over by anyone else; they have simply stopped.¡±

¡°As a woman in a very male-dominated society, the theory goes, she might be reluctant to push herself forward publicly straight away, preferring instead to bide her time while governing from behind the scenes.¡±

However, Everard says though it is ¡°not impossible¡± that Kim Yo-jong has stepped up to the leadership, ¡°it is as hard to disprove this theory as it is to find anything to support it¡±.

Kim Yo-jong, whose name is also spelt Kim Yeo-jung, is believed to act as an adviser for her brother, as other members of the Kim family have done relatives did previously for both him and his father, the late leader Kim Jong-il, before him.

Her elder sister, Kim Sul-song, for example, held a key role in the party¡¯s powerful propaganda department under their father. Their aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, was similarly influential until she fell out of favour last year after her husband ? Kim¡¯s former mentor ? was executed. She is now believed to be in hiding.

In the absence of independent media inside the secretive state, speculation about what lies behind Kim¡¯s absence, and whether he is still in power, continues.

¡°The young leader¡¯s absence certainly does deepen our questions about how their system might change or operate without him,¡± said Adam Cathcart, a lecturer in history at Leeds University and editor of North Korea news and analysis website Sino-NK.com.

He too expressed doubts that North Korea might have quietly seen a woman take supreme power for the first time.

¡°Without Kim Jong-un in the forefront, North Korea¡¯s government [remains] a highly conservative patriarchy run by old men for whom Moscow 1956 is the standard for dangerous liberalism. Regardless of who is in charge, it will keep the world on its toes ? one thing that the state does extremely well.¡±"
781,"Turkey's president has said it was wrong for the United States to deliver military supplies to Kurdish fighters defending the Syrian city of Kobane after some of the weapons ended up in ISIS' hands.

The Pentagon claims the vast majority of the U.S. supplies dropped over the weekend had reached the Kurdish fighters despite an online video showing jihadists in possession of a bundle.

Tayyip Erdogan today said the mission had been a mistake - adding that he could not understand why the U.S. was so keen to defend Kobane as there were no longer any citizens in the city.

The weapons drop had been considered a highly sensitive subject for Turkey, who says the Kurdish fighter provided with American weapons are linked to the Kurdish People¡¯s Protection Unit (YPG) ? a group Ankara considers to be a terrorist organisation.

Error: Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan said it was wrong for the United States to deliver military supplies to Kurdish fighters defending the Syrian city of Kobane after some of the weapons ended up in ISIS' hands

A still from an Islamic State (ISIS) video, purportedly shows an IS militant displaying the content of a crate carrying grenades near the town of Ain al-Arab, known by the Kurds as Kobane, on the Syria-Turkey border

Speaking at a news conference in Ankara today, Erdogan described the weapons drop as a mistake.

'What was done here on this subject turned out to be wrong. Why did it turn out wrong? Because some of the weapons they dropped from those C130s were seized by ISIL,¡¯ he said, using an alternative acronym for ISIS.

Asked about a plan for Turkey to facilitate the passage of Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga fighters to Kobane to help in its defence, Erdogan said he proposed this move in a telephone call with Barack Obama at the weekend.

'I have difficulty understanding why KobanE is so strategic for them because there are no civilians there, just around 2,000 fighters,' Erdogan said.

'At first they didn't say yes to peshmergas, but then they gave a partial yes and we said we would help.'

He added that talks were continuing among officials on the details of the peshmergas' transit through Turkey.

One Turkish journalist close to the government said on Wednesday some 500 of them were expected to cross into Kobani this weekend

A U.S. military airdrop of weapons meant for Kurdish fighters fell into the hands of their jihadist foes near the Syrian battleground town of Kobane, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said

Earlier, the US Defense Department said is investigating video footage appearing to show Islamic State fanatics with at least one cache of weapons airdropped by coalition forces that was meant for Kurdish militiamen battling the extremist group in a border town.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State (ISIS) group.

The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the militants had seized at least one cache.

The caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobane that lies near the Turkish border.

The militant group has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

Yesterday ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said 'Team USA.'

But the lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss.

The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed IS fighting positions, an IS building and a large IS unit.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria."
782,"American photojournalist James Wright Foley has been beheaded by ISIS forces

Foley speaks to camera before his death and labels the US his killers

Apparently coerced by his captors into speaking against his country

After the execution of Foley, the ISIS member says that missing American journalist Steven Joel Sotloff will be killed next

A man identified as Sotloff in a caption on the video is then paraded in front of the camera

Beheading comes one day after ISIS threat to America that 'we will drown all you in blood' following the US-aided Kurdish recapture of the Mosul Dam

Horrific video of American freelance photo-journalist James Wright Foley, 40, being beheaded by ISIS in revenge for US airstrikes in Iraq was posted to the internet Tuesday afternoon.
Foley, has been missing since November, 2012, after being taken hostage at gunpoint while reporting from Taftanaz, in northern Syria, for the agency, GlobalPost. 
ISIS posted the extremely graphic video shot at an unknown location, titled 'A Message to America' to social media as proof of their barbaric actions.
In a chilling warning at the end of grisly film, the executioner, who has what sounds like a British accent, paraded another American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff, who went missing in August 2013, saying: 'The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.'

The video emerged as President Barack Obama was returning from the White House to his Martha's Vineyard vacation. White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden says the administration has seen the video. 
She says that if it¡¯s deemed genuine by the intelligence community, the US would be ¡®appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist.¡¯
His family issued a statement through their Free James Foley organization, which has been working to free the journalist.
'We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.'
As the disturbing video infolds, Foley, dressed in orange and on his knees, is unflinching to the end as he addresses the camera before his death. 
It appears the journalist has been coerced into blaming the United States by his brutal captors. His voice strong, but struggling at times to swallow as he battles against fear, he brands the US government his real killers as a man in black robes armed with a gun stands over him.

Foley who has been missing for almost two years also leaves a haunting message for his brother, John, who is thought to be in the US Air Force. 
Referring to US airstrikes launched nearly two weeks ago in Iraq, Foley says: ¡®I died that day, John, when your colleagues dropped that bomb on these people. They signed my death certificate¡¯ 
As the appalling video unfolds, Foley blames the 'complacency and criminality' of the United States for his impending death.
In his final, awful message to the world, Foley pleads for more time, to have seen his family who fought for his freedom for two years again. In a final insult from his vengeful executioners, Foley is made to deny his birthright as a citizen of the United States.
'I wish I had more time, I wish I could have the hope of freedom and see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn¡¯t American,' says Foley before his tragic death.

The reporter then stops speaking and his executioner steps forward. The masked, armed and black robe-clad man speaks in English in what is thought to be a British accent.
Members of the UK's Associated Press pegged the accent to the South East of England and London, while others have claimed the accent resembles one from North Africa.
¡®This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country. As a government you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards the Islamic State,' begins the executioner.
'You have plotted against us and gone far out of your way to find reasons to interfere in our affairs. Today, your military airforce is attacking us daily in Iraq. 
'Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims. You are no longer fighting an insurgency. 
'We are an Islamic Army and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide. 
'So effectively, any aggression toward the Islamic State is aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic Caliphate as their leadership.
'So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic Caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.¡¯

At this point the executioner beheads Foley, who is kneeling bravely with hands tied behind his back. His body is displayed with the head atop the body.
Then in another chilling warning, the executioner holds another man, on his kness with his hands tied behind his back, by the scruff of the neck. A caption claims it is Steven Joel Soltoff.
The executioner says: ¡®The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.¡¯
GlobalPost's co-founder, Charles Sennott told ABC News that there is 'no reliable proof that this execution is authentic.
'If the video is verified, it is just unfathomable darkness to think that a life as bright as Jim Foley's ended that way,' Sennott said. 'He was an experienced and fearless journalist who believed deeply in reporting from the frontlines.' 
The gruesome video clip opens with President Obama announcing the commencement of American air strikes on Iraq against ISIS.
'Today I authorized two operations in Iraq: targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel, and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water, and facing almost certain death,' says Obama in a statement dated, August 7.
ISIS, which has claimed control of most of northern Iraq and parts of Syria is threatening to kill Time journalist Joel Sotloff next unless President Obama ceases attacks on the terror group. 
Sotloff has been missing since the middle of 2013 and last tweeted on August 3rd, 2013.
According to his Twitter account he was in Libya at the time of his disappearance.
Foley¡¯s family including parents John and Diane, of Rochester, New Hampshire, have publicly appealed for their son¡¯s release over the past two years.
Foley was previously held captive by pro-Gaddafi forces in Libya.

The barbaric beheading comes one day after ISIS militants threatened to attack U.S. targets 'in any place' in a chilling video showing a blood-spattered Star and Stripes next to the jihadist flag with the message in English: 'We will drown all of you in blood'.
Unlike Al Qaeda, the Islamic State has so far focused on seizing land in Iraq and Syria for its self-proclaimed caliphate, not spectacular attacks on Western targets.
It came as President Barack Obama on Monday announced that Kurdish peshmerga troops, supported by U.S. jets, had recaptured the strategically important Mosul Dam, hailing the offensive as a 'major step forward'.
The dam had given the militants control over power and water supplies, and any breach of the vulnerable structure would have threatened thousands of lives.
As the U.S. military strikes the Islamic State group in Iraq, Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces also stepped up their own campaign against militant strongholds in Syria.

Foley, who lived Boston, was previously held captive by pro-Gaddafi forces for six weeks in Libya in 2011.
He was released after 45 days following an international campaign by his friends and family.
The Foley family from Rochester, New Hampshire, had hoped keeping silent could aid his release from Syria, but early last year decided to appeal directly to his kidnappers, increasingly concerned as they grew increasingly concerned.
'We want Jim to come safely home, or at least we need to speak with him to know he's okay,' his father John Foley said in a statement in January 2013 as the Foley family launched a website to publicize his disappearance, 'Jim is an objective journalist and we appeal for the release of Jim unharmed. To the people who have Jim, please contact us so we can work together toward his release.'
James, or Jim as he is known to his family and friends, is one of five children to parents John and Diane Foley. 
Foley, who studied at Marquette University, Milwaukee, and later studied journalism at Northwestern University, Chicago, has also reported on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Prior to a career in journalism, he taught reading and writing skills to convicted felons at Cook County Jail in Chicago."
787,"A guru who ordered 400 of his followers to undergo castrations he said would bring them closer to God is under investigation by police in India.

The country's top crime fighting agency registered a case against Gurmeet Ram Rahim - known as the 'guru in bling' for his penchant for garish clothes and jewellery - over the operations at his ashram.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said Rahim is being investigated for criminal intimidation and causing grievous bodily hurt after an alleged 400 castrations were carried out.

'Guru in bling': Gurmeet Ram Rahim is being probed by India's Central Bureau of Investigation after a former follower alleged he ordered 400 men to submit to castrations he said would bring them closer to god

The guru, who heads the Dera Sacha Sauda organisation based in Haryana state, is already facing trial for conspiracy over the murder of a journalist in 2002, as well as with claims of sexually exploiting female followers.

The latest case was filed after one of his devotees, Hansraj Chauhan, lodged a complaint in court alleging he was manipulated into having the 'painful' operation at the ashram.

'They were told that only those who get castrated will be able to meet god,' Mr Chauhan's lawyer, Navkiran Singh, told AFP. 'We will put all the facts of the case to the court and seek compensation for the victims.'

Mr Singh said doctors carried out the castrations over a period from 2000, but for years his client had been too scared to come forward.

The court asked the CBI to carry out an investigation into the alleged castrations.

The Times of India reports that Mr Chauhan said he was castrated at Rahim's ashram by doctors acting on the guru's orders.

A court-mandated medical examination determined that Mr Chauhan had indeed been surgically castrated.

Rahim, 47, yesterday hit back at the accusations, telling a press conference convened to plug his new movie he is considering legal action of his own against his accusers.

'Such allegations disturb me, when I am doing good for humanity. Therefore me and my legal advisor are going to move the court challenging the allegations,' said Rahim.

Colourful: The guru, who heads the Dera Sacha Sauda organisation in Haryana state, is already facing trial for conspiracy over the 2002 murder of a journalist, as well as with claims of sexually exploiting female followers

The Dera Sacha Sauda says it is a social welfare and spiritual organisation with millions of followers in India and broad.

On its website, the group describes Rahim as a saint as well as an author, inventor, scientist, philosopher, philanthropist, peace activist and 'the ultimate humanitarian'.

Rahim stars in an action movie to be released later this month called 'MSG: Messenger of God' in which the guru fights criminals, sings songs and is shown dousing himself in water in slow motion after a rugby game.

India has been rocked by numerous scandals involving popular godmen who are mostly Hindu ascetics claiming to possess mystical powers.

In November, police arrested Baba Rampal Maharaj after a long and violent siege at his ashram in Haryana when he refused to comply with court orders in a murder case.

In a bizarre case, devotees of a dead guru are fighting a court battle in Punjab state to preserve his body in a freezer, insisting he is only meditating.

For many Indians, gurus play an integral role in daily life. They say they offer a pathway to enlightenment in return for spiritual devotion and often give donations to ashrams, temples and charity projects."

790,"The Apple Watch will not be an accessory for your iPhone - but your iPhone will be an accessory for your Apple Watch, claims technology writer John Gruber, who expects the new wearable to cost upwards of $10,000 (?6,500/¢æ8,800). Due to go on sale in April, the Apple Watch will start at $349 for the basic Sport model with a rubber strap, but beyond that no one knows how much the stainless steel and 18-karat gold Edition models will cost. A debate between technology and wristwatch experts is under way to determine how far into uncharted water Apple is willing to sail. First, Stephen Foskett of Grail Watch chimed in, suggesting (although using self-proclaimed """"back of envelope"""" maths) the gold Apple Watch Edition will cost at least $10,000, based on the materials used. Foskett points to the huge gap in prices between stainless steel and gold versions of Swiss watches of a similar size and shape to the Apple Watch, noting how the Cartier Tank - a watch praised by Apple design chief Jony Ive - costs $7,000 in steel and $22,000 in pink gold. The Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime, slightly larger than the 42mm Apple Watch, costs $8,550 in steel and $23,000 in gold - and a gold strap is a further $20,000. Apple must also price the Watch so it is protected against the volatility of gold. Foskett said: """"[Watchmakers] can't price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labour, distribution and profit in a watch."""" Will the Apple Watch be gold plated to save costs? Apple Watch will go on sale before the end of April(Apple) Foskett says not. Although Apple doesn't describe the Watch Edition as being """"solid gold,"""" it does say it is """"crafted from 18-karat gold,"""" and nowhere is the material described as plated or gold filled. Entering the jewellery market means complying with new regulation, Foskett explains. """"There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could."""" Add to this Apple's claims of producing the Watch from gold twice as hard as standard gold, and it is clear that the company will not be scrimping on materials. Foskett believes $9,999 for the 42mm model and $7,999 for the 38mm version of the gold Watch Edition could well be possible. Days later, Apple commentator John Gruber blogged to say he also thinks the price will be $10,000. """"The more I think about it, and the more I learn about the watch industry, the world of luxury goods, and the booming upper class of China, the better I feel about that bet. I don't think I was wrong to place a friendly late night bar bet on a $9,999 starting price [for the gold model]."""" Gold straps Gruber says a """"starting price"""" because he expects Apple to announce a new gold band when the Watch finally gets a price and release date - and for this he suspects the company will charge an additional $10,000. Looking at how Rolex charges a much higher premium for its gold models over steel - and for watches with identical movements - Gruber says the Apple Watch Edition """"is not a tech product, so don't try to price it like one... Apple's ambitions in this arena, I am convinced, are almost boundless."""" Buying the Watch Edition will be unlike buying any other product in Apple's history. Reports claim the company will store the watches in safes, and that it is even considering completely separate boutique stores to sell them. Apple is expected to reveal the Watch's pricing structure and release date at a media event before the end of April 2014.

The only issue with all of these sites covering the story of Lucita Sandoval, however, is that almost none of it is true, as Gawker points out.

Local Santiago del Estero newspaper Nuevo Diario debunked the Lucita Sandoval sex tape last week.

Those familiar with eBay know that keeping tabs on live bids is crucial to winning an auction, and eBay is apparently working on a project that could potentially stream results directly to your wrist, according to a recently posted job listing for an Apple Watch software engineer. The ad first appeared on eBay's official careers webpage in November, but gained wider exposure when it was posted to LinkedIn earlier this month.

According to the ad, eBay's Apple Watch app is being developed by the company's New Technology Group as an augmentation of its flagship iOS app, much like other first-generation titles announced by Apple. It is unclear if eBay for Apple Watch will work untethered, that is without constant connection to an iPhone, but with the wearable's Wi-Fi capabilities, such an implementation is in the realm of possibility.

An ideal candidate will have five years of experience in software design and development and at least three years experience developing iOS apps object-oriented design patterns and principles. Development experience with Android or Windows 8 is considered a bonus.

Alongside Apple Watch apps, eBay's New Technology Group is tasked with developing solutions for CarPlay, Apple TV and other """"opportunities within the Apple ecosystem."""" The division is based out of Portland, Ore. and has over 200 employees in its ranks.

Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the company's quarterly conference call on Tuesday that Apple Watch is scheduled to ship in April, just making a self-imposed """"early 2015"""" deadline. The eBay job listing didn't specify if or when the Apple Watch app would be completed, but a two-month turnaround could be possible depending on feature depth and existing progress."

The 29-year-old claims she and her husband love both their children, but they are willing to sell their son (pictured together) to a good home in order to try and save the life of his twin sister

The boy's twin sister (pictured with Xiangyan) is suffering from leukemia and requires life-saving treatment

In the pictures, he can be seen eating what appears to be candied fruit and standing alongside his mother as she appeals for someone to come forward and buy him.

She said: 'Up until a year ago we had a wonderful family and we thought we had everything we could need with a wonderful little boy and a wonderful little girl who are twins.

'But all that changed when my daughter was diagnosed as suffering from leukemia in August of last year and we spent all of our savings and borrowed everything we could from friends and relatives.

'It still wasn't enough, and now we are hoping to raise cash from the sale of our son.'

Medical staff say the child is suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia and needs urgent medical treatment that includes chemotherapy every 10 days at the Rizhao Municipal Hospital.

The family have sold their apartment and everything in it and are now living in a tiny 10sqm flat close to where the chemotherapy is being carried out.

They are struggling to heat the tiny apartment which is vital to prevent the child, weakened by chemotherapy, from suffering in the cold which could be fatal.

Their attempt to sell their son follows a similar situation last month in which a woman was spotted trying to sell her baby daughter on the streets of China in order to pay her husband's ?10,000 medical bill.

Ni Qiong was photographed roadside in Fuzhou, southeastern China, with a written sign imploring pedestrians to purchase her one-year-old daughter.

She and her husband Zhou Xinggui are both migrant workers, but he is currently in hospital needing surgery after falling off scaffolding.

Despite remaining on the street for four hours, no pedestrians offered to purchase her daughter.

His wife's sign read: 'Please buy my daughter. My husband is waiting for surgery fees in the hospital as his boss ran away. I would like to sell my daughter and save my husband.'"
798,"TOKYO ? North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has been hospitalized after surgery on both ankles earlier this month, a South Korean newspaper reported.

Kim cracked bones in his ankles after neglecting an injury sustained during field supervisions in June, the Chosun Ilbo said, citing a recent visitor to North Korea it didn¡¯t identify. The person said Kim had surgery and is recovering at Bongwha Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members, according to the newspaper.

Kim has not been seen in public in almost a month and missed a session of parliament on Sept. 25 for the first time since coming to power almost three years ago. In an unusual acknowledgment, North Korean state television said he was experiencing ¡°discomfort,¡± and South Korea¡¯s Yonhap News reported he is believed to be suffering from gout.

Tuesday¡¯s report comes as Glyn Davies, the top U.S. envoy for North Korea, said the isolated state is neglecting its responsibilities to end its nuclear weapon program. Speaking in Beijing on a trip through North Asia, Davies told reporters Monday it¡¯s essential that North Korea moves toward denuclearization.


¡°Today¡¯s news may even prompt an acceleration of North Korea¡¯s nuclear program, and missile tests,¡± said Hideshi Takesada, a professor at Takushoku University in Tokyo who specializes in North Korean affairs. ¡°He¡¯ll probably be keen to show there are no issues in the nation¡¯s power structure.¡±
The activities of North Korea¡¯s leader are the subject of intense scrutiny in Asia and beyond because of his family¡¯s dynastic rule, its drive to develop a nuclear arsenal and the secrecy of a regime that faces South Korea across one of the world¡¯s most heavily-armed borders.

In fractured ankle cases, a doctor may need to set the broken bone back into place with a splint or cast, and surgery may be required to repair the break, according to WebMD, an online medical dictionary. It can take as long as two years to completely recover full pain-free motion and strength, though most people can return to a normal routine in three or four months.

Even so, speculation remains in the South Korean media that Kim may be unwell. Footage in July and earlier this month showed the country¡¯s leader walking with a limp, and Kim appeared to have gained weight.

Surgery to the ankles could be consistent with gout, Alastair Hepburn, a consultant rheumatologist and a Medical Trustee of the U.K. Gout Society.

¡°It¡¯s unusual but it¡¯s possible,¡± Hepburn said in a telephone interview Tuesday. Severe gout can damage the joints, making an operation necessary, he said.
¡°Gout is a very painful and debilitating condition,¡± he said. ¡°It can lead to a situation when limping becomes obvious because of the pain. A person can be quite well for some time, and then there may be sudden flare ups, which cause more pain.¡±

Sometimes the situation is solved, and other times, if the flare-ups keep occurring, the condition becomes chronic, Hepburn said.

Gout is a form of arthritis that isn¡¯t fatal, though it can be agonizingly painful. The condition is caused by a buildup of a waste product in the blood called uric acid, which normally is eliminated from the body through urine, according to Britain¡¯s National Health Service. Uric acid can cause needle-like crystals to form, which seep into joints and cause inflammation.

Surgery may be needed to remove gritty, chalky nodules known as tophi if uric acid crystals build up in joints, according to WebMD.

The South Korean government is cautious about making a hasty assessment of the situation given the amount of speculation over Kim¡¯s disappearance from public view, Yonhap reported Tuesday, citing an unidentified government official. People will now be watching to see if he attends the anniversary of the Workers¡¯ Party on Oct. 10., according to the news agency."
800,"Well, here¡¯s the creepiest thing you¡¯ll read all day. Australian Dylan Thomas found a tropical spider burrowed UNDER his skin after returning from a trip to Bali.

Thomas said that he noticed a strange mark on his stomach while vacationing on the Indonesian island. The mark started to grow, literally crawling across his body, as the spider explored the area underneath Thomas¡¯ skin.

Thomas went to the hospital in Bali and was told that he was probably bitten by an insect. The doctors gave him some medicine and sent him on his way. Well, that didn¡¯t exactly solve the problem.

Over the next three days the strange mark continued to grow. He eventually returned to the hospital where a dermatology specialist discovered a spider living under his skin.

Thomas wrote on Facebook: ¡°Well after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider that¡¯s been living inside of me for the last 3 days, managed to get it out luckily.¡±

Dylan Thomas¡¯ story started in a local Australian newspaper but has now spread all over the internet. Of course, there are some who question the veracity behind Thomas¡¯ claim.

Snopes.com writes: ¡°Thomas¡¯ claims were widely reported but no recorded cases of a spider burrowing into live human tissue have ever been confirmed. Urban legends of spiders living under human skin or laying eggs have circulated for more than a century, but no evidence has emerged to indicate it is likely or possible for a spider to live under human skin ¡¦ It is also worth pointing out that not only has a spider never been known to harm a human in the manner described, it also likely could not live for three days inside a scar and would probably suffocate in short order.¡±

803,"A goldfish lover from Norfolk paid hundreds of pounds in vets' fees when his pet became constipated.

The owner took his ailing fish to Toll Barn Veterinary Centre in North Walsham where vets told him it was constipated and an operation would cost about ?300.

Vet Faye Bethell used anaesthetised water to knock out the goldfish before removing the blockages.

""""At the end of the day they're all pets and everybody does have a commitment to their pet,"""" Miss Bethell said.

""""[The goldfish] was constipated because he had a lump blocking his bottom, rather than because of his diet or any other reason,"""" she said.

The operation, which took almost an hour, was performed by Miss Bethell, assisted by two veterinary nurses.

""""We've got one nurse who bubbles anaesthetic gas through a tube that goes in through its mouth and over its gills, and then we have a second nurse to monitor with a probe to check the heart rate,"""" Miss Bethell said.

A fake news story was published at a fake website this week claiming that Macaulay Culkin was found dead at his apartment.

The fake news story reads: ¡°Sources are reporting that Macaulay Culkin, best known for his role as Kevin McCallister in Home Alone and sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, has been found dead at the age of 34.¡±

This led to an ¡°RIP Macaulay Culkin¡± Facebook page and numerous tweets from people mourning the loss of the world¡¯s greatest child actor.

Suresh Kumar was set upon in Ganganagar, in India's northwestern Rajasthan state, after locals heard the girl's screams for help.

After finding the 40-year-old pinning the girl against a wall, a lynch mob dragged him to a butchers shop where they beat him with sticks for an hour before castrating him.

They then dumped the severed remains in the middle of a road and lefta bloodied Kumar nearby.

Aamir Dhawan, 30, said no one 'went to help' Kumar because they knew he had been punished for a 'sex crime'.

Mr Dhawan said: 'We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it's time it stopped.

'This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.'

But the police have called for those responsible to come forward, saying people can't take the law into their 'own hands'.

Kumar was eventually taken to hospital where doctors described his condition as critical.

The girl involved was treated for shock, and given counselling.

The castration follows a string of violent sex crimes in India that have prompted vigilante justice.

In July, one man was killed and two others were badly hurt after being accused of raping and hanging a seven-year-old girl.

The girl was discovered hanging from a tree near the village of Kaliabazar, West Bengal, and angry villagers quickly rounded up a local 'Tantrik' holy man and his two friends.

The trio were mercilessly beaten. One later died in hospital and the two others required extensive treatment.

That incident was a grim reminder of an incident in Badaun, Uttar Pradesh, some weeks before where two sisters were raped and then hanged from a tree outside their village."

People caught with marijuana in New York City may no longer face arrest ? as the police consider implementing a ticketing system.

Under the scheme people found with small amounts of cannabis would be issued with a court summons but would not be handcuffed or taken to a police station for fingerprinting, according to The New York Times.

Low-level marijuana possession is one of the most common drug offences seen by the New York Police Department (NYPD) and law officials have been seeking a new way of addressing the problem.

Many low-level marijuana arrests take place in black and Latino communities, thereby impacting negatively on relations with police.

Mayor Bill de Blasio - who won a hotly contested Democratic primary in September last year by focusing on the controversial ¡°stop-and-frisk¡± police tactic endorsed by Michael Bloomberg and by criticizing the billionaire mayor for presiding over ¡°two New Yorks¡± (one rich, one poor) - is said to be welcoming the potential change.

808,"A Catholic priest from Massachusetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal O¡¯neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival. With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.

The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered.

The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.

He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like ¡°Being of Light¡±.

¡°Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting¡± states the Catholic priest. ¡°She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother¡¯s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn¡¯t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!¡±

The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.
Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O¡¯neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the ¡°Holy Mother¡±.

¡°I wish to continue preaching¡± says the elderly cleric. ¡°I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman¡¦¡±

815,"The new season of Game of Thrones starts next month, and you know what that means: Cue the mad dash to secure someone's HBO Go password in time. But for cord cutters (and cord never-getters) who want to tune in online, this year may mark the first time they've been able to do so without breaking the rules.

HBO is reportedly in talks with Apple to be the launch partner for its highly anticipated streaming service that wouldn't require a cable subscription, according to International Business Times. HBO Now, as it's allegedly being called, would cost $15/month and open up access to HBO's film and TV titles to distributors like Apple TV and Roku.

HBO's existing streaming app HBO Go is currently available only through a cable subscription. Last year, HBO announced that it would finally unbundle its streaming services from cable in 2015, and the HBO Now launch could be signals that HBO is making good on that promise.

It's unclear how the HBO Now library would measure up to HBO Go's current offerings, but the companies are reportedly trying to wrap up negotiations in time for the Season 5 premiere of Game of Thrones next month. So it's likely a safe bet that recent HBO content would be available through the Apple service.

At a price point that's double the monthly fee for both Netflix and Hulu, the new service had better deliver on quantity, as both services offer robust streaming libraries of their own. However, while the quality of the content on those services can vary wildly, the HBO brand is known for its acclaimed original series like The Wire, The Sopranos, and Six Feet Under.

Fans of HBO's programming, who increasingly occupy a demographic that's moving away from cable, have long craved a cable-free streaming service?but HBO has deflected the matter for years.

Presumably, the HBO Now launch must navigate the complexities of HBO's longstanding relationship with cable carriers?Time Warner, HBO's parent company, reportedly makes 70% of its profits from cable subscriptions. But if the current negotiations with Apple are successful, the Now service could be HBO's first crack at making good on its promise to cord cutters."
816,"A previously unverified audio recording that allegedly captures the final moments of Michael Brown¡¯s life has been verified as authentic, according to the video streaming application it was recorded on.

A resident living in the apartment complex where Brown was killed was using a video messaging app called Glide at the time of the shooting and unwittingly captured the sound of gunfire, according to a lawyer representing the resident, whose identity has not been released.

The recording suggests nearly a dozen shots were fired in an altercation between Brown, who was unarmed at the time, and Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson.

According to Glide the recording was created at 12:02 p.m. CT on Saturday Aug. 9, precisely the time police say Brown was shot.

¡°A Glide user living nearby (whose identity is being protected) was simply using the Glide app on their smartphone exactly as it was designed ? to instantly communicate with a friend through our real-time video texting service. Simultaneously, they also captured audio in the background of the gunshots allegedly fired at Michael Brown,¡± Glide said in a statement released on Thursday. ¡°Because Glide is the only messaging application using streaming video technology, each message is simultaneously recorded and transmitted, so the exact time can be verified to the second.¡±

The lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal, said she has shared the recording with the FBI. Federal officials won¡¯t confirm they have this specific recording, but do confirm they are collecting any audio and video of the incident. 

The audio could prove to be critical piece of evidence in the ongoing investigation into Brown¡¯s death. It also seems to confirm what some witnesses to the shooting say happened during the incident.

They said Brown, who was black, and Wilson, who is white, were seen struggling through the driver¡¯s side window of Wilson¡¯s police car. They said Wilson fired a single shot from inside his car and then fired several more as Brown attempted to flee. Some witnesses, viewing the incident from different vantage points, have said Wilson fired several shots at Brown and that at some point the boy turned around with his hands up, at which point Wilson fired several more gunshots.

The audio does not capture what happened just moments before or after the shooting. And law enforcement officials say that at this stage it¡¯s impossible to know what the significance of this tape may be.

Days before the release of the audio earlier this week, Tommy Chatman-Bey, who lives in the Canefield Green Apartment complex near where Brown was killed, told msnbc that he was outside at the time of the shooting and was an ear-witness.

¡°I was right out there when I heard it,¡± Chatman-Bey said. ¡°I heard Boom, Boom, Boom, pause, Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom and then some more.¡±

The police have not provided many details about the shooting and have not released a detailed police incident report. What Ferguson police have released is a report with little more than the date, time and location of the incident. But more curious are the time stamps on the document. Typically an incident report following a homicide would give a detailed account.

The report, released only after the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri sued under open records law, suggests a supervisor had not reviewed it until Aug. 19, 10 days after the fatal shooting. Final sign-off wasn¡¯t given until Aug. 20, the report appears to indicate.

Glide in their statement said, ¡°While tragedy is never good news, and our hearts go out to the family of Michael Brown, this incident underscores how technology is changing the landscape of not only journalism, but also criminology. We commend this Glide user for turning their Glide video message over to FBI investigators as possible evidence in this ongoing investigation.¡±

A key question could be why Wilson paused in the midst of the barrage.

Brown was struck with at least six bullets including two that hit his skull, according to an autopsy performed at the behest of Brown¡¯s family. Lawyers for Brown¡¯s family have been critical of what forensic examiners identified as the two head shots that actually killed Brown. At least one of the shots struck Brown at the top of his head. Witnesses claim that as Brown fell to his knees and attempted to surrender to Wilson that the officer continued to walk toward him, firing several more shots.

St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch began presenting evidence in the case to a grand jury last week and said a decision on whether or not Wilson will be charged may not come until October."
817,"It¡¯s been more than a month since North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un¡¯s last public appearance. In the last 36 days, rumors have swirled, increasing in bizarre factor with each absent day ? gout, diabetes, ankle problems, cheese-induced illness, etc. But the latest theory has nothing to do with his health. A group of defectors claim that Kim Jong-un¡¯s sister Kim Yo-jong is now in charge of the dictatorship, at least temporarily while Kim recuperates, or finishes whatever it is he¡¯s been doing on his hiatus.

The claim comes from the North Korea Intellectuals¡¯ Solidarity, a Seoul-based advocacy think tank started by former North Korean professors. The group has not revealed its source, so it¡¯s just an allegation at this point, but one that makes sense.

According to Michael Madden, who tracks the country¡¯s officials with his North Korea Leadership Watch blog, Kim Yo-jong is one of the few people known to have ¡°unfettered direct access¡± to the supreme leader, and Madeen speculates that she may currently be his ¡°sole gatekeeper.¡±

The sister theory comes amid some more serious theories that a coup may be imminent. On Saturday, three elite North Korean officials made an appearance at the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in South Korea, one of which was Organization and Guidance Department (OGD) member Hwang Pyong-so. The OGD has long been rumored to be the puppet masters of Kim¡¯s regime, only allowing the portly leader to be a symbolic figurehead for the sake of continuing the Kim dynasty. Hwang¡¯s appearance only further suggests that the OGD have seized control of the regime.

But if video evidence of Kim limping is any indication, the dictator is likely recovering from whatever mysterious ¡°discomfort¡± he¡¯s been experiencing, and little sis is making sure things still get done, as little sisters often do.

Who Is Kim Yo-Jong?

While Kim has a half-sister, whom his father, Kim Jong-il had with another wife, Kim Yo-jong is his only full sister. Four years younger at age 27, Kim Yo-jong reportedly joined her brother for elementary school in Switzerland from 1996 to 2000. Currently, she is an official in Workers¡¯ Party of Korea (WPK), North Korea¡¯s ruling political party. According to North Korea Leadership Watch, Kim Yo-jong works as her brother¡¯s personal aide and manages his itineraries, public events, and logistical needs. Sounds like a hybrid of manager, publicist, and personal assistant.

Kim Yo-Jong¡¯s Emergence

The North Korea Leadership Watch notes her first public appearance in September 2010, when she attended a photocall for participants of the 3rd Korean Workers¡¯ Party Conference, where she stood among her father¡¯s staff. By the following year, she was a regular member of her father¡¯s entourage, and at Kim Jong-il¡¯s funeral in December 2011, state media revealed her leading senior party officials in bowing at the casket.

Before his death, Kim Jong-il included a ¡°significant and unknown¡± role for Kim Yo-jong in his succession planning. Madden described her duties under the KJI regime to CNN, calling her

an ¡°advance-team leader¡±

who inspected sites before official visits and performed administrative duties.

Now, Madden says, she has taken on even more responsibility as a regular fixture by Kim Jong-un¡¯s side, receiving intelligence briefings and contributing to policy. In fact, Madden believes that she played a large part in planning the three officials¡¯ trip to the Asian Games in South Korea. If true, this would suggest that the Kim dynasty is still perfectly intact, and a coup is just one of the many wild theories.

According to an attorney for an unidentified man who lives in an apartment building near the site of the shooting, the recording captures as many as 11 shots fired in the Aug. 9 incident.

The audio, which was played on CNN Monday night, could not immediately be verified by The Washington Post. But a burst of gunfire can be heard (six shots), followed by a pause, and then several more shots (at least four).

¡°He was in his apartment, he was talking to a friend on a video chat, he heard loud noises and at the moment ? at the time he didn¡¯t realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards,¡± the man¡¯s lawyer, Lopa Blumenthal, said in an interview with CNN¡¯s Don Lemon. ¡°It just happened to capture 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.¡±

According to Blumenthal, FBI agents came to her office on Monday to interview the man about the recording.

Neither Ferguson nor St. Louis County police have contacted the man or Blumenthal about the video. After interviewing him on Monday, she said the FBI indicated that they planned to speak with him again on Tuesday.

Autopsy reports conducted by St. Louis County and by the Brown family found that Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head.

825,"Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Saturday that US journalist Luke Somers was killed by militants during an operation aimed at freeing him from his Al-Qaeda kidnappers in Yemen.

""""US Special Operations Forces conducted a mission in Yemen to rescue a US citizen, Luke Somers, and any other foreign nationals held hostage with him by Al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) terrorists,"""" Hagel said in a statement released during a visit to Kabul.

""""Both Mr. Somers and a second non-US citizen hostage were murdered by the AQAP terrorists during the course of the operation.""""

A grab taken from a propaganda video released by al-Malahem Media on December 4, 2014 purportedly shows US hostage Luke Somers, 33, kidnapped more than a year ago in the Yemeni capital Sanaa, saying that his life is in danger

A charity that had been involved in negotiations said the second dead hostage was Pierre Korkie from South Africa.

Hagel added that Friday's operation was undertaken when """"there were compelling reasons to believe Mr. Somers' life was in imminent danger.""""

""""Several of the AQAP terrorists holding the hostages captive were killed in the mission,"""" he said.

""""The rescue attempt took place in central Yemen and was conducted in partnership with the Government of Yemen.

""""Yesterday's mission is a reminder of America's unrelenting commitment to the safety of our fellow citizens -- wherever they might be around the world.

""""I commend the troops who undertook this dangerous mission.""""

826,"American photojournalist Luke Somers, held hostage by al Qaeda in Yemen, was killed Saturday in a failed rescue attempt, his sister said. There was no immediate comment from Washington about operation, which Yemeni officials said was conducted jointly by the U.S. and Yemen.

The British-born hostage's sister, Lucy, told NBC News' partner ITV News and The Associated Press that the FBI had inform the family of the 33-year-old's death.

The operation took place in Shabwa province, a Yemen interior ministry official told NBC News, adding that 10 militants were also killed. It came two days after the Pentagon acknowledged an earlier U.S. commando mission to rescue Somers had failed. Teacher and photographer Somers, a British-born U.S. citizen, was abducted a year ago in Sanaa where he had been working as a freelance photographer for the Yemen Times.

Al Qaeda posted a video Thursday that showed Somers and a local militant commander threatening that thwe hostage would meet his fate in three days if the U.S. didn't meet the group's demands.

This is a breaking news story."
827,"A Macedonian man who was dumped by his girlfriend when she told him he was not any good in bed chopped off his penis and threw it in the bin.

The man told medics that he felt his small sized penis was to blame for the fact he had been dumped by his girlfriend, and as it was useless decided to cut it off.

Oliver Ilic, 22, had called medics after he could not stop the bleeding and was taken on a stretcher in bloodstained jeans to hospital in the eastern town of Kocani.

Police searched his house and discovered the severed organ in a bin after it had been cut off with a single swipe from a razor blade which was also lying in the bin. But although it was delivered to the local hospital, doctors realised they did not have the competence to reattach the member. Instead Ilic was transferred to the hospital in the capital Skopje where surgeons managed to reattach it in a complicated five-hour surgery.

However they said it was still too early to know if the operation would be a success and if it was a success whether the man's organ would ever function properly again.

This was the second recent example of a Macedonian man cutting off a penis. Another 40-year-old man did the same a short while ago but in his case the member was not reattached because he had thrown it into the toilet and flushed it away."

Constantine responded again, CBC reported: """"Look just letting everyone know this ain't a joke or intended !!!! I was just been honest about turning in Monday morn that's all !!!!""""

829,"By: Press Trust of India | New Delhi | Posted: January 8, 2015 2:10 pm
A senior official of the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) was on Thursday dismissed from service for unauthorized absence from duty for 25 years.
As disciplinary authority, Urban Development Minister Venkaiah Naidu directed dismissal from service of Executive Engineer (Electrical), A K Verma, after the charge of wilful absence from duty against him was proven in an inquiry set up to probe the matter.
A senior ministry official said that Verma, who had joined CPWD as an Assistant Executive Engineer in 1980, went on Earned Leave in December, 1990 and did not report to work thereafter.
Verma went on seeking extension of leave which was not sanctioned and defied directions to report to work. An inquiry was instituted against him in September, 1992 for major penalty for wilful absence from duty.
Due to non-cooperation of Verma with the inquiry and for other reasons, it got delayed and a fresh charge sheet was issued in 2005.
The inquiry report, establishing the charges was submitted in July, 2007 and the same was accepted by the then Minister of Urban Development in August, 2007. But no further action was taken in the matter.
Seeking to streamline the functioning of CPWD and to ensure accountability, Naidu, soon after assuming office directed review of pending vigilance and disciplinary cases for expeditious action against the accused.
Verma¡¯s case surfaced in due course and Naidu directed his dismissal from service.
The Minister has taken serious view of in-action since 2007 and directed the concerned to fix responsibility for delay in the matter"
830,"Suresh Kumar, 40, was set upon after locals in the Indian city of Ganganagar heard a teenage girl¡¯s screams from down an alley

A man accused of trying to rape a teenage girl is in a critical condition after locals hacked off his genitals with a meat cleaver in a butcher shop.

After hearing terrified screams, an angry mob took the law into its own hands and dragged Suresh Kumar, 40, into a butchers in the city of Ganganagar, India.

He was found down an alley, pinning the terrified girl against a wall.

Following a community meeting, the vigilantes decided to drag him to a local butcher¡¯s shop where they beat him with sticks for an hour, before chopping off his genitalia with a meat cleaver.

The remains were then dumped in the middle of the road with Kumar's bleeding body nearby.

Local Aamir Dhawan, 30, said: """"No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime.

""""We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it¡¯s time it stopped.

""""This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.""""

Police have called for those responsible to come forward.

A police spokesman said: """"People cannot take the law into your own hands.

""""As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice.

""""We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.

The man was eventually taken to hospital where doctors described his condition as critical.

The girl was treated for shock, and given counselling."
831,"LONDON ? The world knows him as ¡°Jihadi John,¡± the masked man with a British accent who has beheaded several hostages held by the Islamic State and who taunts audiences in videos circulated widely online.

But his real name, according to friends and others familiar with his case, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a well-to-do family who grew up in West London and graduated from college with a degree in computer programming. He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the Islamic State, the group whose barbarity he has come to symbolize.

¡°I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John,¡± said one of Emwazi¡¯s close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post. ¡°He was like a brother to me. . . . I am sure it is him.¡±

[View: The atrocities of the Islamic State]

A representative of a British human rights group who had been in contact with Emwazi before he left for Syria also said he believed Emwazi was Jihadi John, a moniker given to him by some of the hostages he once held.

¡°There was an extremely strong resemblance,¡± Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said after watching one of the videos. ¡°This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person.¡±

Authorities have used a variety of investigative techniques, including voice analysis and interviews with former hostages, to try to identify Jihadi John. James B. Comey, the director of the FBI, said in September ? only a month after the Briton was seen in a video killing American journalist James Foley ? that officials believed they had succeeded.

Nevertheless, the identity of Jihadi John has remained shrouded in secrecy. Since Foley¡¯s killing, he has appeared in a series of videos documenting the gruesome killings of other hostages, including four other Westerners, some of whom he personally beheaded.

[Read: The tactics of Islamic State beheadings]

In each, he is dressed in all black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm.

A spokeswoman for the British Embassy in Washington said: ¡°Our prime minister has been clear that we want all those who have committed murder on behalf of ISIL to face justice for the appalling acts carried out. There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by ISIL in Syria. It is not appropriate for the government to comment on any part of it while this continues.¡± ISIL is another name for the Islamic State.

U.S. officials declined to comment for this report. Emwazi¡¯s family declined a request for an interview, citing legal advice.

The Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, in his mid-20s, appears to have left little trail on social media or elsewhere online. Those who knew him say he was polite and had a penchant for wearing stylish clothes while adhering to the tenets of his Islamic faith. He had a beard and was mindful of making eye contact with women, friends said.

He was raised in a middle-class neighborhood in London and on occasion prayed at a mosque in Greenwich.

The friends, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the investigation, believe that Emwazi started to radicalize after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster.

Emwazi and two friends ? a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib ? never made it on the trip. Once they landed in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight. It¡¯s unclear whether the reason for the detention was made clear to the three, but they were eventually deported.

Emwazi flew to Amsterdam, where he claimed that an officer from MI5, Britain¡¯s domestic security agency, accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates in the southern part of the country, according to e-mails that he sent to Qureshi and that were provided to The Post.

Emwazi denied the accusation and claimed that MI5 representatives had tried to recruit him. But a former hostage said Jihadi John was obsessed with Somalia and made his captives watch videos about al-Shabab, which is allied with al-Qaeda.

The episode was described in the Independent, a British newspaper, which identified Emwazi as Muhammad ibn Muazzam.

Emwazi and his friends were allowed to return to Britain, where he met with Qureshi in the fall of 2009 to discuss what had happened. ¡°Mohammed was quite incensed by his treatment, that he had been very unfairly treated,¡± Qureshi said.

Shortly afterward, Emwazi decided to move to his birthplace, Kuwait, where he landed a job working for a computer company, according to the e-mails he wrote to Qureshi. He came back to London twice, the second time to finalize his wedding plans to a woman in Kuwait.

In June 2010, however, counterterrorism officials in Britain detained him again ? this time fingerprinting him and searching his belongings. When he tried to fly back to Kuwait the next day, he was prevented from doing so.

¡°I had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started,¡± he wrote in a June 2010 e-mail to Qureshi. But now ¡°I feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London. A person imprisoned & controlled by security service men, stopping me from living my new life in my birthplace & country, Kuwait.¡±

Nearly four months later, when a court in New York sentenced Aafia Siddiqui, an al-Qaeda operative convicted for the attempted murder of U.S. personnel in Afghanistan, Emwazi expressed sympathy for her, saying he had ¡°heard the upsetting news regarding our sister. . . . This should only keep us firmer towards fighting for freedom and justice!!!¡±

In the interview, Qureshi said he last heard from Emwazi in January 2012, when Emwazi sent him an e-mail seeking advice.

¡°This is a young man who was ready to exhaust every single kind of avenue within the machinery of the state to bring a change for his personal situation,¡± Qureshi said. In the end, he felt ¡°actions were taken to criminalize him and he had no way to do something against these actions.¡±

Close friends of Emwazi¡¯s also said his situation in London had made him desperate to leave the country. It¡¯s unclear exactly when he reached Syria or how.

One friend said he believed Emwazi wanted to travel to Saudi Arabia to teach English in 2012 but was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, the friend said, he was gone.

¡°He was upset and wanted to start a life elsewhere,¡± one of the friends said. ¡°He at some stage reached the point where he was really just trying to find another way to get out.¡±

Once in Syria, Emwazi contacted his family and at least one of his friends. It¡¯s unclear what he told them about his activities there.

A former hostage who was debriefed by officials upon release said that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. The hostages nicknamed the facility ¡°the box.¡± Emwazi was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed ¡°George.¡± A former hostage said Emwazi participated in the waterboarding of four Western hostages.

Former hostages described George as the leader of the trio. Jihadi John, they said, was quiet and intelligent. ¡°He was the most deliberate,¡± a former hostage said.

Beginning in early 2014, the hostages were moved to a prison in the Syrian city of Raqqa, the Islamic State¡¯s de facto capital, where they were visited often by the trio. They appeared to have taken on more powerful roles within the Islamic State.

About the same time, Qureshi said, he sent an e-mail to Emwazi.

¡°I was wondering if you could send me your number,¡± he wrote. ¡°Inshallah [God willing] it will be good to catch up.¡±

There was no response.

832,"London, Nov 24 : Kim Jong-un has been guzzling litres of rare snake wine to perk up his love life with wife, it has been reported. The cases of the pricey plonk with the body of a deadly cobra inside the bottle were delivered at the supreme leader¡¯s palace in North Korea, the Daily Star reported. Locals believe snake wine helps men get their partners pregnant and improve the size of their manhood.

The 31-year-old despot, and his wife Ri Jol-su, are said to be having problems adding to their family because of his weight. The ruler¡¯s waistline has expanded because of his love of imported French cheese and Johnnie Walker whisky. Sources revealed that the elite in the country joke that Jong-un is now too big to please his wife and that¡¯s why they do not have any other children.

Earlier he was missing altogether from the scene and his puzzling absence created a lot of curiosity. Kim Jong-Un has made his first public appearance for more than a month, with state media today reporting a visit to a new housing complex in Pyongyang. It marked the first time Kim has been seen since September 3 ? an extended absence that fueled intense speculation, including rumours of a serious illness or even a coup.

The North¡¯s official KCNA news agency said Kim made a ¡°field guidance¡± tour of the new residential complex specially built for scientists working on North Korea¡¯s satellite programme. ¡±Looking over the exterior of the apartment houses and public buildings, decorated with diverse colored tiles, (Kim) expressed great satisfaction, saying they looked very beautiful,¡± the agency said.

837,"On Friday, Nigerian armed forces chief Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh announced a ceasefire between President Goodluck Jonathan¡¯s administration and the extremist group Boko Haram. Bedeh claimed the truce, which was widely welcomed, would lay the groundwork for the release of the more than 200 girls who were abducted in April, spurring the explosion of the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls.

On Saturday, the supposedly appeased group launched an attack on a town in Adamawa State in eastern Nigeria, capturing 40 women and planting a flag in the town of Wagga. They also beheaded six victims during an assault on Friday, after the ceasefire deal was announced. All of which makes a truce, supposedly negotiated with the ¡°chief of security¡± of the Boko Haram group and the Nigerian government, seem decidedly shaky.

The ceasefire claims, and Boko Haram¡¯s subsequent actions, have left people in Nigeria scratching their heads, with experts saying the ceasefire may have been a mirage, either a fraud concocted by the government or the middleman who brokered the agreement, whose real-life links to Boko Haram are now in dispute.

Alleged Boko Haram envoy Danladi Ahmadu is now under scrutiny, with many questioning whether he is in fact the group¡¯s chief of security and has the authority to speak on its behalf. During an interview on Friday, Ahmadu didn¡¯t explicitly say that Boko Haram had agreed to a ceasefire, and he did not give details of the girls¡¯ release, Arab News reports. Elders in Borno state in Nigeria¡¯s north-east have publicly said that they believe the government was negotiating with a fraudster, and have yet to talk to the real Boko Haram.

Boko Haram, meanwhile, has not released a public statement about the ceasefire. Rather, they have continued on a weekend campaign of violence, holding running battles with Nigerian security forces, who say that they have yet to receive any word from their superiors ordering them to cease fire in skirmished with the insurgents.

¡°It is not clear who the said Boko Haram negotiator is, and whether he has the mandate of the entire group or just a faction of the entire group,¡± Arab News quoted Nnamdi Obasi, senior analyst of Nigeria for Crisis Group, an independent, nongovernmental organization.

Some people think the announcement is a political move by President Jonathan to inspire optimism in voters and win their support, as it¡¯s rumored he will announce his run for re-election in February 2015 over the next few weeks. The government said it has been working on negotiations with Boko Haram for months."
839,"WASHINGTON ? The Pentagon on Friday confirmed that the leader of al-Shabab, an al-Qaeda-linked organization in Africa, was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Somalia this week.

The leader, Ahmed Abdi Godane, was targeted Monday in an airstrike that hit a vehicle and compound in a militant stronghold south of the capital, Mogadishu.

Al-Shabab has been linked to a number of attacks in Africa, including the bloody siege at the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, in September 2013 that killed 67 people.

""""Removing Godane from the battlefield is a major symbolic and operational loss to al-Shabab,"""" Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement.

At the time of the strike, the Pentagon said it could not confirm Godane's death.

Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions were used to strike the targets. Both manned aircraft and unmanned drones participated in the attack.

The Pentagon said no U.S. ground troops were involved in the operation.

""""The United States works in coordination with its friends, allies and partners to counter the regional and global threats posed by violent extremist organizations,"""" Kirby said in the statement released Friday.

The United States has backed the Somali government, which has pushed the terrorist groups out of Mogadishu. Despite the government successes, the terror group has been able to operate in parts of the country that remain out of the reach of the government's influence.

The White House said it would continue to pursue the organization.

""""Even as this is an important step forward in the fight against al-Shabab, the United States will continue to use the tools at our disposal ?- financial, diplomatic, intelligence and military ?- to address the threat that al-Shabaab and other terrorist groups pose to the United States and the American people,"""" the White House said in a statement."
840,"Suspected militant Islamists have shot and slaughtered people in three villages in north-east Nigeria, despite government claims that it had agreed a truce with them, residents say.

Boko Haram fighters raided two villages on Saturday, and raised their flag in a third, residents said.

The government said it would continue negotiating with Boko Haram, despite the alleged breach of the truce.

It hopes the group will this week free more than 200 girls it seized in April.

Boko Haram has not commented on the announcement made on Friday that a truce had been agreed, and that the militants would release the schoolgirls abducted from the remote north-eastern town of Chibok.

'Promise honoured'

Boko Haram is reportedly represented in the talks, taking place in neighbouring Chad, by Danladi Ahmadu.

However, Mr Ahmadu was """"bogus"""" and an """"imposter"""", said Ahmad Salkida, a Nigerian journalist with good contacts in Boko Haram.

The abduction of the girls sparked a global campaign to pressure the government to secure their release.

Government negotiator Hassan Tukur said Boko Haram had """"honoured its first promise"""" by releasing 27 Cameroonian and Chinese nationals on 11 October, after capturing them in separate raids in May and July, Nigeria's privately owned This Day newspaper reports.

""""Since it delivered on its promise to Cameroon, we expect Boko Haram to deliver on the release of the Chibok girls and the cessation of hostilities in north-eastern Nigeria,"""" he said.

Chad's President Idris Deby is mediating between the two sides, Nigeria's government says.

'Friend killed'

However, Saturday's attacks have caused many Nigerians to doubt whether the government has really negotiated a truce with Boko Haram, especially as no statement has been issued by its leader Abubakar Shekau, says BBC Nigeria analyst Bilkisu Babangida.

Will 'truce' with Boko Haram free Chibok girls?

Boko Haram fighters burnt homes and killed many people during raids on the villages of Grata and Pina in Adamawa state, a resident told BBC Hausa.

As they marched from Grata to Pina, they also slit the throats of villagers whom they came across, he added.

In a separate attack, the militants raided Abadam village in neighbouring Borno state, and raised their flag over the village, a resident who fled the area told the BBC.

His friend was among those who had been killed by the militants, the resident said.

Many people had fled across the border to Niger, he added.

Mr Tukur said the government was trying to """"verify where the attacks are coming from"""".

""""As you know, it is difficult to have a ceasefire in an organisation that has many members and cells/units,"""" he is quoted by This Day as saying.

In May 2013, President Goodluck Jonathan imposed a state of emergency in the northern states of Borno, Yobe and Adamawa, vowing to crush the Islamist insurgency.

But Boko Haram has increased its attacks this year.

The group promotes a version of Islam which makes it """"haram"""", or forbidden, for Muslims to take part in any political or social activity associated with Western society.

It frequently attacks schools and colleges, which it sees as a symbol of Western culture."
842,"A 280 pound catfish was caught by a fisherman in Italy. According to USA Today Sports, Dino Ferrari caught the huge fish in Po Delta. While the catfish caught by Ferrari was 8.7 feet in length and weighed 280 pounds, the largest catfish ever caught weighed 300 pounds. That does not mean that this wasn¡¯t a record-breaking fish, however. According to the report, this might be the largest catfish ever caught using a generic fishing rod.

According to the San Antonio Express-News, any catfish over 6.5 feet is considered extremely rare. Ferrari isn¡¯t some small time fisherman, either. According to Grind TV, the Italy native is a pro at catching big Wels catfish, and many of these fish frequent the waters where Ferrari casts his line.

¡°The wels catfish is the second-largest freshwater fish in its region, ranking behind the beluga sturgeon. The largest beluga sturgeon on record is reportedly 3,463 pounds.¡±

The 280 pound catfish is certainly a sight to see, as it looks as if it could swallow Ferrari whole. He posed for photos with the fish, clearly very proud of his catch (even appearing to hug it while his brother took some pictures), which took him a tiring 40 minutes to reel in. It is almost hard to believe that catfish can get that big!

Animal lovers may be happy to know that Ferrari did not keep the catfish, nor did he sell it for money. After his brother took a couple of pictures of the creature, the guys released it back into the river, where it swam off, happy to live another day.

As previously reported by the Inquisitr, these Wels catfish aren¡¯t exactly harmless; this certainly is not the type of sea creature that you would want to swim into. And it is definitely not a ¡°gentle giant¡± by any means.

¡°Dino¡¯s monster catch is not the sort of fish you¡¯d want to accidentally swim into while skinny dipping. The fish has a ferocious appetite and will consume anything that happens to cross its path. These surly catfish have even been filmed eating pigeons after our feathery friends happened to fly too close to these cold-blooded killers.¡±

Pictures of the 280 pound catfish are making waves on the internet today. Have you ever seen a catfish so big? Would you want to see a Wels catfish in person?

844,"Planetary Alignment On Jan 4, 2015 Will Decrease Gravity For 5 Minutes Causing Partial Weightlessness.

Strange natural occurrences are happening in the world today. But nothing more magnificent than the one you will experience on January 4, 2015.

According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth¡¯s own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.

Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they do so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation.

Astronomers have long been aware that there would be an alignment of the planets on that date, when Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto would be on the same side of the sun, within an arc 95¡Æ wide. But now they are guaranteeing the occurrence as the gravitational effect of the other planets on the Earth¡¯s crust is maximum even at their closest approach.

But don¡¯t get too excited. If you think you¡¯ll be able to float around your house, you¡¯re wrong. But, if you jump in the air at 9:47 AM PST, on January 4, 2015, it should take you about 3 seconds to land back on your feet instead of the usual 0.2 seconds.

846,"Several Iraqi news sources, including Al Sabah and the website al-Maalomah, reported on Wednesday that several ISIS fighters sought help at a hospital in Mosul, 250 miles north of the city of Baghdad, after developing symptoms of Ebola virus infection.
Citing anonymous sources in a hospital in Mosul, Al-Sabah reported that two cases of Ebola and 26 cases of HIV/AIDS were confirmed by health authorities in Mosul. The newspaper also claimed that ISIS recruits from some African countries brought the virus to Iraq.
The International Business Times UK also carried a similar report, quoting Iraqi news sources.
But a spokesperson for the Iraqi health ministry, Ahmed Rudaini, has denied reports that two cases of Ebola virus infection were diagnosed among ISIS militants in Mosul. The Iraqi health ministry spokesperson said the infection couldn't have been confirmed in Mosul because none of the hospitals in the city have the diagnostic facilities. He said only the Central Laboratory of Public Health in Baghdad has the ability to confirm cases of Ebola virus infection.
Responding to inquiries from Mashable, a WHO spokesperson, Christy Feigh, said, """"We have no official notification that it is Ebola.""""
Feigh said the WHO was investigating the reports and would give assistance if needed. But because UN workers are banned from entering ISIS-held areas in Iraq and Syria, it is unclear how the organization would be able to confirm the report or render assistance in suspected cases.
Mashable, however, reports that a Kurdish official who appeared convinced that the reports were accurate told the Kurdish news outlet Xendan that the militants reported at the hospital in Mosul with symptoms of Ebola virus infection.
While Iraqi health officials are probably not taking the reports seriously, an outbreak of Ebola among ISIS militants could have serious consequences due to lack of access to the ISIS-held areas. It is also feared that ISIS militants could use the presence of the virus among its militants as a terror weapon against opponents, further complicating the prosecution of the war against the extremist group.
However, the symptoms of Ebola virus, including vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding in the late stages of the disease are similar to those of several other diseases, including malaria, yellow fever and typhoid fever. Thus, it is possible that the militants who reported at the hospital in Mosul were suffering from other diseases that have symptoms similar to Ebola.
Given the fact that the reports were carried exclusively on pro-government newspapers, it is not possible to rule out that they were designed to cause confusion among ISIS fighters and discourage new recruits from joining the group. It is not known that ISIS has a significant number of recruits from West African countries where the epidemic has been reported. Thousands of foreign recruits to ISIS arrived mostly from North African countries such as Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Algeria and Somalia where there have been no reports of Ebola outbreak.
The Ebola virus epidemic has claimed thousands of lives in the West African countries of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.
Recently, Nigerian news sources reported that ISIS was making efforts to recruit fighters from the country. The report led the Nigerian government to issue a statement urging some Middle Eastern countries to carry out thorough background checks on Nigerians applying for visas.
The report that some ISIS militants might have contracted Ebola comes a few weeks after Benjamin T. Decker, intelligence analyst and Iraq specialist with the Middle East research firm Levantine Group, said that ISIS executed about 11 doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat wounded militants.
Mosul was among several cities ISIS fighters captured earlier in the year 2014. The militants declared an Islamic caliphate in the areas they captured. Mosul, in particular, has been under ISIS control since June 2014. The city has reportedly suffered food, water and power shortages since extremist militants took over. Residents have suffered brutal treatment with reports of executions and enslavement of minorities women and children.
On Wednesday, the US and its allies carried out 17 airstrikes in Syria and 12 in Iraq. The airstrikes in Syria targeted ISIS facilities in Al Raqqah, Dayr az Zawr and Kobani, while the strikes in Iraq hit ISIS buildings and positions around Mosul, Fallujah and Sinja."
847,"¡°A Message To America,¡± a video uploaded Tuesday to YouTube, begins with a clip of President Obama announcing his recent authorization of targeted airstrikes and a humanitarian operation in Iraq. Then, around the two minute mark, a man believed to be James Wright Foley, 40, delivers a statement:

¡°I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers: the U.S. government,¡± he says, before specifically addressing his brother John, a member of the U.S. Air Force. (A full transcript of his last words was posted online by the blogger Brown Moses and can be found here.)

About two minutes and 20 seconds later, the man is apparently beheaded. His executioner, whose face is covered, has what sounds like a British accent and threatens that ¡°any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.¡±

Two people who know Foley said the man in the video appears to be him, and that the voice sounds like his. A Facebook page that is part of the Foley family¡¯s appeal to find and bring Foley home posted the following statement: ¡°We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.¡±

Foley, a freelance photojournalist for the AFP and GlobalPost, and his translator were kidnapped in Binesh, Syria, in November 2012. According to the FBI, his translator was later released.

The propaganda video ends with a shot of another kneeling man in orange believed to be missing journalist Steven Sotloff. ¡°The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,¡± the executioner says.

A version of the clip viewed by BuzzFeed was removed from YouTube after about 20 minutes, though others have been uploaded since.

848,"Washington (CNN) -- The man who jumped the White House fence earlier this month and breached the building's doors actually made it farther than originally thought, the Washington Post reported Monday.
Omar Gonzalez, a 42-year-old Iraq war veteran who had a knife in his pocket, overcame one Secret Service officer and sprinted all the way into the East Room of the White House, where he was then tackled, the Post reported, citing """"three people familiar with the incident.""""
Secret Service officials had previously told reporters that Gonzalez made it to just inside the north portico White House doors.
The Post reported that Gonzalez ran through much of the main floor, past a stairway that leads up to the first family's residence, and was ultimately stopped at the far southern end of the East Room. He also reached the doorway to the Green Room, an area that looks out on the South Lawn.

850,"THE spy agencies MI5 and MI6 have identified the British fighter suspected of murdering the US journalist James Foley, British government sources confirmed yesterday.

The masked man with a London accent, who is said to be known as Jihadi John, was seen in the shocking video of Foley¡¯s death released by the Islamic State extremist army last week.

While sources gave no details of the man they have identified, a key suspect is Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 23, who left his family¡¯s ?1?million ($1.78m) home in Maida Vale, west London, last year. He recently tweeted a picture of himself holding up a severed head.

The intelligence agencies and police estimate up to 20 British extremists a month are now travelling to Syria and Iraq to fight with Islamic State. The rate has risen since Islamic State declared a ¡°caliphate¡± eight weeks ago. US ¡©officials said America was considering carrying out drone strikes on Islamic State leaders in Syria as it steps up its activities in the country, and could also provide more help for moderate rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad.

Pentagon sources claimed President Barack Obama agonised for weeks over whether to authorise a mission to rescue Foley and other foreign hostages. Delta Force commandos finally launched the mission on July 4 but the hostages had been moved.

¡°They were ready to go in June to grab the guy and they weren¡¯t permitted,¡± said Anthony Shaffer, a former lieutenant colonel who worked on covert operations.

Writing in The Sunday Times yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond accused Foley¡¯s killer of ¡°an utter betrayal¡± of everything the British people stand for. ¡°It is horrifying to think that the perpetrator of this ¡©heinous act could have been brought up in Britain,¡± he wrote.

Mr Hammond said Foley¡¯s death was ¡°a reminder to us all that Islamic extremism in Iraq and Syria is not only causing huge suffering in those countries but is also a barbaric ideology threatening us at home¡±.

Unless Islamic State is stopped, ¡°sooner or later they will seek to strike us on British soil¡±, he wrote.

The comments are the most ¡©explicit warning yet from a British cabinet minister about the risk of an attack against the country.

The British government, he wrote, was ¡°investing significant resources to tackle this problem for the long term¡± and to disrupt Islamic State¡¯s ability ¡°to organise, raise funds and attack us here in Britain¡±.

While ¡°we must support the overwhelming majority of British Muslims who are moderate, law-abiding people with values and morals we all share ... we should be in no doubt that we have a vital ¡©national interest in tackling the threat from Islamic State,¡± he said.

Government sources insisted that while the option of British air strikes on the jihadists remained on the table, they ¡°are not being actively considered or proposed at this stage¡±.

Military planners are, however, drawing up plans to deploy scores of British troops to help train a ¡°substantial¡± number of Iraqi troops and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters.

Training will focus on the use of heavy weaponry such as artillery, mortars and Milan antitank weapons.

Sources said Britain was exploring the possibility of establishing training camps in the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq and in Baghdad, although the high security risk meant the training could take place in Jordan or Britain instead.

851,"Not only has the upcoming Steve Jobs biopic likely found an actor to play Jobs, it may have found an actor to play Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak too: according to The Wrap, Seth Rogen is being considered for the role. Variety reports more definitely that he's actually set to play it. Rogen would be acting alongside Christian Bale, who is reported to have taken the part of Jobs. Danny Boyle, who made Trainspotting and 28 Days Later, is directing based on a script by Aaron Sorkin. Jessica Chastain is also reported to be under consideration for a part, though it isn't known who she would be playing.

THIS ISN'T A DONE DEAL YET

Rogen is certainly an interesting casting choice, but with how little is known about this movie, it's hard to really gauge what it means. For one, it's not clear how large the role of Wozniak will be: the film is supposed to take place in the moments preceding three major Apple product launches, and Wozniak wouldn't necessarily be around for all of those, having left Apple in 1985. We've also seen successful pairings of strong dramatic actors, like Bale, with traditionally comedic actors, like Rogen, in the past to quite a bit of success ? see last year's The Wolf of Wall Street, for example ? so it's possible that Boyle is trying to emulate that here.

That all said, The Hollywood Reporter says that it isn't clear if an offer has been made to Rogen yet, but that the film's producers do want him on board. The Reporter also says that Bale's deal is yet to close and remains at a delicate stage ? though Sorkin has suggested that he's on board. This Sorkin-scripted Jobs film has had a rocky development process and has already had to restart once, when David Fincher was dropped from being its director. Still, it's sounding more and more like the studio behind this film is eager to get it made, so perhaps we'll see some confirmation on all of this soon."
852,"After a solid week of coming to terms with the fact that Steve Jobs is Batman, we've found ourselves in a Job-less world once more. Now that Christian Bale's thrown in the tiny circular glasses, we ask you, dear readers, who's your Jobsian ideal?

853,"It's a common practice around the world to speed up TV shows in order to insert more commercial time. The subtle speeding up can slice a couple of minutes from a 22 minute sitcom with little noticeable difference--and broadcasters can plug in two more minutes of commercials per half hour! It's a last ditch effort, perhaps, to extract money out of a dying media delivery system before streaming obliterates the advertising model. TBS does it with Seinfeld reruns (see below) and worldwide it happens all the time--from the BBC to India.

But is that all there is to it--trying to make more money? Actually many viewers point out that TV shows (and everything else) move faster now in the age of the 6-second Vine. The speeding up actually helps the content itself seem more contemporary. Here's one commenter: """"Honestly, shows move a lot faster now and the sped up version feels a little more updated than the original slower version. But who even watches actual TV anymore? No TV + adblock on 90% of internet = very little advertising = happy me :)"""""
854,"Momentum for the Apple Watch will likely take a short time to build driven mostly by apps, one analyst believes, with sales quickly escalating to 10 million units in the holiday 2015 shopping season.

Keith Bachman of BMO Capital Markets believe Apple will sell 19 million Apple Watch units in calendar year 2015, with more than half of those being sold in the December quarter. His prediction was issued in a new note to investors this week, a copy of which was provided to AppleInsider.

Bachman is bullish on the Apple Watch, but he believes it will take some time for applications to be built that will truly sell the public on the upcoming wrist-worn device.

His estimates suggest there will be an installed base of more than 484 million iPhone users as of December 2015. Sales of 19 million Apple Watch units would equate to 3.9 percent of the total user base.

For fiscal year 2016, Bachman believes Apple will sell 36.5 million of the Apple Watch, growing to 10.9 percent of iPhone users by September of 2016.

Bachman's confidence in the Apple Watch comes despite the fact that there is still much not known about the wearable. In particular, he's especially curious to find out final pricing, application availability, and battery life.

Regarding the high-end price point, BMO's analyst isn't concerned if the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition sells for more than $10,000. He suspects Apple will sell very few units at that price, as most high-end watch consumers will opt for a brand like Rolex that can stand the test of time.

Bachman also isn't concerned about suspected battery life of around 24 hours. He noted that most consumers have become accustomed to recharging their iPhone at night by their bedside, and he expects Apple Watch users will do the same.

BMO has maintained its price target of $135 for shares of AAPL, along with an """"outperform"""" rating."
855,"U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter this week declared terrorists have been crossing the Rio Grande.

The California Republican, speaking to Greta Van Susteren on Fox News Oct. 7, 2014, said he¡¯d learned from the U.S. Border Patrol that Islamic State fighters had been nabbed trying to enter the country from Mexico. """"ISIS is coming across the southern border,"""" Hunter said, adding a moment later: """"I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.""""

Border Patrol agents """"caught them,"""" Hunter also said, but """"you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""""

Our eyebrows were raised. We sought detail.

No federal or state confirmation

No state or federal law enforcement agency confirmed Hunter¡¯s account when we inquired, and Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper declined to reveal the congressman¡¯s sources.

Fox News, in its original Oct. 8, 2014, online news report on Hunter¡¯s declaration, quoted the Department of Homeland Security disputing his account.

Homeland Security told PolitiFact Texas that no such apprehensions have occurred. An agency spokeswoman, Marsha Catron, emailed: """"The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground. DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""""

And after Hunter spoke, the Texas Department of Public Safety wrote state legislators, saying in an Oct. 8, 2014, email it """"does not have any information to confirm"""" statements about Islamic terrorists or ISIS fighters entering the country. A DPS spokesman, Tom Vinger, confirmed the message¡¯s authenticity.

In the message, a DPS deputy director, Robert Bodisch, mentioned the Hunter interview and an Oct. 8, 2014, news report by Judicial Watch, a conservative news website, stating Islamic terrorists had entered the country from Mexico. According to unidentified Homeland Security sources, Judicial Watch said four terrorists had been apprehended in the previous 36 hours by federal authorities and the DPS in McAllen and Pharr.

In the message to legislators, Bodisch further wrote: """"An unsecure border is certainly a vulnerability that can be exploited by criminals of all kinds, and it would be na?ve to rule out the possibility that any criminal organization would not look for opportunities to take advantage of security gaps along our international border. That said, DPS does not have any information to confirm the specific statements recently reported in the press.""""

On Sept. 17, 2014, PolitiFact in Washington analyzed an August 2014 Judicial Watch story, finding Mostly False another congressman¡¯s claim that """"we know that ISIS is present in Ciudad Juarez,"""" which neighbors El Paso. Research did not turn up any law enforcement official or news outlet that independently verified or corroborated the claim, making the declaration that """"we know"""" with certainty ISIS is in Juarez a big stretch.

For this fact check, a terrorism expert said Hunter¡¯s claim doesn¡¯t make much sense.

""""It¡¯s implausible given the way the criminal-justice system works to have 10 ISIS fighters arrested at the border and never charged,"""" said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, director of the Center for the Study of Terrorist Radicalization at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington.

Gartenstein-Ross said by phone he knows of """"no reporting coming through DHS suggesting that a large number of ISIS fighters have been intercepted at the border. I¡¯ve talked to a large number of people within the department, and the department has unequivocally denied it. There¡¯s not one shred of evidence this is the case.""""

Kasper, informed we'd not confirmed Hunter's statement, said Hunter stands by what he said.

Kasper also expressed doubt federal agencies are revealing the facts about fighters getting caught.

""""Problem here is that this is always a zero-sum game,"""" Kasper wrote. """"We make the point. Official channels deny. Then, maybe in a few years from now the information will pop up on the front page of the Washington Post,""""  much like that newspaper this week reported new details about the Secret Service prostitution scandal, Kasper said.

Our ruling

Hunter said """"at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas"""" and there are """"dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""""

No government agency confirms anything remotely close to the idea that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border. Notably, too, the lead Texas agency entrusted with public safety alerted legislators of its own lack of confirmation. Similarly, the idea there are """"dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol"""" is missing a factual basis.

All told, this statement strikes us as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

PANTS ON FIRE ? The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

856,"Kim Jong-un has broken both of his ankles and is now in the hospital after undergoing surgery, a report in a South Korean newspaper claims.

The North Korean leader has been missing for more than three weeks, fueling speculation about what could cause his unusual disappearance from the public eye. Some rumors indicated that he was suffering from gout, others speculated it was a sign of some sort of internal struggle within the secretive North Korean regime, and some even said he was simply getting ill by eating too much Swiss cheese.

But on Tuesday, South Korean newspaper The Chosun Ilbo added a new twist, reporting that Kim was hospitalized in mid-September and had surgery at the Bonghwa Clinic, a hospital for high-ranking government officials in the capital, Pyongyang.

""""I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,"""" an anonymous source was quoted as saying.

Apparently, Kim sprained his right ankle while wearing Cuban heels during a tour of military bases and factories, the paper reported. Kim was seen limping in July during a TV appearance.

The paper said that Kim was still in the hospital, under heavy protection from bodyguards, and was receiving visits from several government officials.

This rumor seems to confirm what North Korean state media had said on Thursday, when state broadcaster Korean Central Television reported that Kim was """"not feeling well,"""" and was suffering from an """"uncomfortable physical condition.""""

In a related report by the Inquisitr, it¡¯s claimed that Ian Fleming, the author of the famous James Bond series, helped former President Kennedy to hatch a Fidel Castro assassination plot.

According to the el Nuevo Herald, the rumors claimed Fidel Castro dead because a man named Fidel Castro Odinga, the son of an important politician in Kenya, died over the weekend at the age of 14 years old.

¡°Castro Odinga was the son of Raila Odinga, the main opposition leader in Kenya and was considered a possible successor to his father. It is possible that his death and his name have confused many users of Twitter, and these have begun to spread the word about the supposed death of the Cuban leader.¡±

Kenyan police are currently investigating Odinga¡¯s death, and these headlines may have encouraged rumors about the Cuban leader.

According to Laiguana TV, it¡¯s also possible that a blog by Yusnaby Perez may have sparked rumors that claimed Fidel Castro dead because he had not been in public in many months.

¡°How strange! It is the first year since I can remember the anniversary of the Revolution that Fidel does not appear.¡±

Thursday marked a year since the former Cuban president made a public appearance. Castro has apparently received foreign dignitaries at his home in Havana, but has not commented publicly on the recent changes between Cuba and the United States that was announced on December 17, 2014.

The rumors were increased even further when Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera reported on Fidel Castro¡¯s death. The newspaper quickly retracted its report, but not before the alleged ¡°news¡± about Castro went viral.

Because of these rumors several media outlets in Venezuela and Cuba claimed the Cuban government planned on calling a press conference to discuss Fidel Castro¡¯s heath condition. But an official from the International Press Centre (CPI), the department Cuban Foreign Ministry serving foreign media, says this rumor is false, saying,

¡°That is false. No press conference was convened, no.¡±

867,"The Isis militant known as Jihadi John has today been named in reports as Mohammed Emwazi

The British Isis militant known as Jihadi John has been identified in reports today as Mohammed Emwazi, from London.

In a lengthy article by The Washington Post, identifying the man suspected of appearing in videos showing the beheading of US and UK hostages, a 2010 report in The Independent is cited, which details claims that Emwazi was detained for 'days' and illegally interrogated by MI5 while on a safari holiday in Africa, before being let go.

It has now been claimed Emwazi started to become radicalised following the events on this trip.

Below is the full report, in which Emwazi is identified as Muhammad ibn Muazzam, from The Independent on Saturday, 01 May, 2010.

British Muslims on safari 'stopped by MI5' (from The Independent on 01/05/2010)

MI5 agents illegally interrogated British Muslims who were detained while on safari holidays in Africa, it was claimed yesterday.

The new allegations mirror cases first raised by The Independent last year in which the security service was accused of harassing and intimidating north London community workers who had returned from Somalia.

Now two British men from west London who visited Tanzania for a week-long safari in May last year say they were arrested and held for ¡°days¡± in inhumane detention on the orders of MI5.

Abu Talib and Muhammad ibn Muazzam, both in their mid-20s, and a German friend travelling with them, allege they were threatened with beatings by members of Tanzania's security forces. After being refused entry to Tanzania they were returned to the Netherlands, where they say they were questioned by MI5 agents who accused them of having links to Islamic extremists.

On their return to the UK the next day, the men allege they were harassed by MI5, who warned them they were now on a terror watch list which prevented them travelling to any Muslim country. Another British citizen, Abu Omar, 19, says that in April 2009 his safari holiday to Kenya was interrupted when the house in which he was staying was raided by local security officers.

Mr Omar claims he was held and questioned for four days, also on the basis of intelligence supplied by MI5. He alleges that his interrogators threw a mobile phone at him which they said had his fingerprints on and was linked to phone calls made to Osama bin Laden. Back in London Mr Omar was further questioned by MI5, who took his fingerprints and photographs.

He told the human rights group Cageprisoners: """"I was left in the airport without money, barefoot and my clothes in bin liners.""""

The new cases bear striking similarities to allegations made by six youth workers from Kentish Town who allege that they too were harassed and unlawfully interrogated after holidays abroad in 2008. Cageprisoners' executive director, Asim Qureshi, said: """"The last seven years of the 'War on Terror' have seen the profiling and criminalisation of the Arab and Pakistani communities by UK authorities around the world. The policies implemented through counter-terrorism legislation and Prevent [the Government's strategy for combating extremism in the Muslim community] have been counter-productive as Muslim communities feel marginalised. Many Muslims feel besieged and the policies of Government have done nothing to temper that.""""

A government spokeswoman said the Security Service """"operated within the law"""" and complaints about officers' alleged behaviour should be made to the independent commissioner who has the power to investigate allegations."

""""ISIS is coming across the southern border,"""" he told Fox News. """"They aren't flying B1 bombers bombing American cities, but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.""""

Hunter continued: """"I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas.""""

He claimed Border Patrol """"caught them,"""" but """"you know there's going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the Border Patrol.""""

The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday denied Hunter's claim.

""""The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,"""" a senior DHS spokesman said. """"DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.""""

But Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper said the information -- that about 10 individuals with """"known ISIS affiliations"""" -- came from a """"high-level source within the Border Patrol.""""

""""The congressman was conveying what he knows -- and what he was told,"""" Kasper said. """"It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn't know what the right hand is doing -- it's been that way for a long time and we don't expect that to change.""""

Obama administration officials previously have downplayed the threat of Islamic State militants infiltrating the U.S. through the southern border, as warnings about that possibility have circulated.

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in an interview with Fox News last week, acknowledged reports that four men with suspected terror ties had been apprehended at the southern border in Texas and questioned. But Johnson said they were """"scrutinized very, very carefully"""" and officials found """"no evidence that these individuals were tied to terrorism.""""

Border Patrol and Homeland Security sources also told Fox News that they have not been able to substantiate Hunter's claim. They said between Sept. 23 and Oct. 6, only five illegal immigrants from """"special interest"""" countries were arrested at the Texas border -- and they were from Bangladesh.

The four men that Johnson referred to were actually Kurds, Fox News is told.

Johnson, at a hearing last month, stressed that the government had """"no specific intelligence or evidence to suggest at present that ISIL is attempting to infiltrate this country though our southern border.""""

At the same hearing, National Counterterrorism Center head Matthew Olsen also said: """"There has been a very small number of sympathizers with ISIL who have posted messages on social media about this, but we've seen nothing to indicate there is any sort of operational effort or plot to infiltrate or move operatives from ISIL"""" into the U.S. through the southern border.

Still, Johnson said the U.S. needs to be """"vigilant"""" and aware of the possibility of """"potential infiltration by ISIL or any other terrorist group.""""

The union representing America's immigration caseworkers also sounded an urgent warning last month about the threat. Kenneth Palinkas, president of the National Citizenship and Immigration Services Council, alleged the administration has made it easier for terrorists to """"exploit"""" the country's visa policies and enter the homeland.

He complained that the administration has """"widened the loophole"""" they could use through the asylum system, and has restricted agents from going after many of those who overstay their visas.

Further, he warned that executive orders being contemplated by President Obama would """"legalize visa overstays"""" and raise """"the threat level to America even higher."""" He said there is """"no doubt"""" many are already being """"targeted for radicalization.""""

872,"The Islamic State militant known as Jihadi John has been identified as Mohammed Emwazi from West London.

The IS frontman is believed to have appeared in a series of shocking videos in which hostages, including British aid worker Alan Henning, are brutally murdered

The 27-year-old was named this morning by the Washington Post and it is understood he is known to British security services.

The paper described him as being from a well-to-do family in West London, graduating from college with a degree in computer programming.

MORE: Soldier who went to fight in Syria ¡®is going to get a smacked bottom¡¯

MORE: Desperate plea for missing schoolgirls ¡®heading to Syria¡¯

A friend said: ¡®I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John. He was like a brother to me¡¦ I am sure it is him.¡¯

His friend added that he was radicalised after a planned trip to Tanzania following his graduation.

British radicalisation experts said they believed the identity to be ¡®accurate and correct¡¯.

A statement from the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at King¡¯s College London said: ¡®We believe the identity and name published by the Washington Post and now in the public realm to be accurate and correct.¡¯

Dressed all in black with a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose and a holster under his left arm, ¡®Jihadi John¡¯ reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning, and American aid worker Peter Kassig.

And last month, the militant appeared in a video with the Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, shortly before they were killed.

A detailed Washington Post article claims Jihadi John is in fact Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, who it says travelled to Syria around 2012 before later joining IS, which has taken control of large swathes of the conflict-torn country, as well as territory in neighbouring Iraq.

The article claims Emwazi started to radicalise after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster was brought to an abrupt end when he was detained on arrival in Dar es Salaam and deported the following day.

It is claimed that he told friends he was flown to Amsterdam where an officer from MI5 accused him of trying to reach Somalia, where the militant group al-Shabab operates.

According to the article, in 2009/2010, Emwazi decided to move to Kuwait, where he told friends he had a job and marriage waiting for him ? but was prevented from travelling there by UK counter-terrorism officials.

Released hostages have told officials that Jihadi John was part of a team guarding Western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria, in 2013. He was joined by two other men with British accents, including one who was dubbed ¡®George¡¯.

The ICSR said: ¡®Jihadi John is not special in the sense that all the foreign fighters have tried to hide their identity by using pseudonyms or literally by masking themselves.

¡®The fact that ¡®Jihadi John¡¯ has been unveiled in this manner demonstrates that whatever efforts are made, the ability to mask one¡¯s identity is limited or in fact impossible, and their true identities will eventually be revealed.

¡®This demonstrates what we have long said about radicalisation, that it is not something driven by poverty or social deprivation. Ideology clearly plays a big role in motivating some men to participate in jihadist causes.

¡®British fighters have clearly demonstrated that they are not in this conflict to take a back seat. They are full participants in this war, operating as suicide bombers, hostage takers, and executioners.¡¯

Scotland Yard has refused to confirm the reports.

Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met¡¯s counter terrorism command, said: ¡®We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

¡®We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.¡¯

Downing Street declined to confirm or deny that the reported name was known to the intelligence and security services.

Asked if David Cameron was concerned about Emwazi¡¯s name being reported, a No 10 spokeswoman said: ¡®The Prime Minister would be concerned about information being put into the public domain at any time that might jeopardise ongoing police or security investigations or the safety of British citizens.

¡®There is an ongoing investigation. It is absolutely right that we allow the police and security agencies to do all they can to bring those responsible to justice and to help keep British people safe.¡¯"
873,"(CNN) -- New York City will apparently change its policy on marijuana possession, giving officers the option to merely ticket offenders instead of requiring an arrest, a law enforcement source told CNN on Monday.

The new policy, reported Sunday by The New York Times, is expected to be announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner William Bratton at a 3 p.m. ET news conference.

Police will have some discretion in deciding whether to issue a ticket or make an arrest, according to the source.

Unlike in some places that have legalized recreational marijuana, New York law still bans possession of the drug. The policy shift only changes how police would enforce the existing law.

CNN's Shimon Prokupecz contributed to this report."
874,"Following the deadly shootings at Charlie Hebdo, a French satirical magazine with a history of lampooning religious extremism, cartoonists came out in droves to support those who were killed Wednesday in the best way they knew how: with their own set of tribute cartoons. Artists from The Independent, The Washington Post, and more published visual depictions of their reaction to the news of the attack, which took the lives of 12 people, a death toll that included four prominent cartoonists. (Charlie Hebdo editor Stephane Charbonnier was perhaps the most high-profile of those killed Wednesday.) And ? for those who flocked to Facebook, Instagram, and other forms of social media Wednesday ? it appeared that Banksy had dedicated his own cartoon to the tragedy. But, come Wednesday night, fans of the elusive street artist would be disappointed to learn that, no, Banksy likely did not draw the stunning pencil image.  

Though it at first appeared as though the artist was responsible for the cartoon after it surfaced on a Banksy Instagram account, it¡¯s believed that the account does not belong to Banksy himself. Not only because Banksy¡¯s official website insists that the artist keeps off social media ? specifically referencing his lack of a Facebook or Twitter account (this short-lived Instagram was the only account that was ever linked to Banksy) ? but also, as Business Insider notes, the cartoon image is far too low-res for an artist with Banksy¡¯s notoriety. Writes the site:

Another clue that points to the image being fake is its file size. The image uploaded to the fake Banksy social media posts is pixelated and low-resolution. Banksy is an artist who makes a living from exhibiting his work, he wouldn¡¯t want his work to be displayed in a way that makes it look bad.
That said, the image itself is striking, and a fitting tribute to those who have passed on following the shootings in Paris. So, though it¡¯s possible Banksy did not design the cartoon (and only leaves you wondering what kind of tribute Banksy would publish), it¡¯s worth digesting, appreciating, and using it to remember that violence will never quell freedom of speech."
877,"Piper Jaffray¡¯s Gene Munster has issued a new report to investors, breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices. The analyst predicts that the stainless steel Apple Watch will be priced at $499, while the 18k Gold Edition will sell for $4,999, AppleInsider reports. He also said that on average, consumers will spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.

Apple watch versions

Apple Watch will be released in three separate price tiers i.e. Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition, with each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices. Starting with Apple Watch Sport, Munster expects an ASP (average selling price) of $450 including configuration choices like case and internal storage options. The stainless steel Apple Watch model is expected to start at $499 to $549, with an overall ASP at around $650. Regarding the Apple Watch Edition, the analyst forecasts the base model to start at $4,999, while classifying segment ASP at $7,500.

Based on current pricing for Apple¡¯s silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars. 

¡°If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,¡± Munster writes. 

Lastly, Munster expects the Sport model to make up 55% of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take 45%. As for Apple Watch Edition, Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year.

Based on what we know so far about the Apple Watch, which model do you plan on getting?"
879,"Matt Taibbi is taking a ¡°leave of absence¡± from Pierre Omidyar¡¯s First Look Media, according to New York Magazine. The move comes ¡°after disagreements with higher-ups inside Omidyar¡¯s organization, a source close to First Look confirmed today.¡±

Over the last year, however, the center of gravity of the organization has shifted, as Omidyar and his Silicon Valley braintrust have exerted control over budgets and vacillated over the journalistic mission. Over the summer, Omidyar appointed a longtime confidante, John Temple ? a former newspaper editor who previously led an Omidyar-financed civic journalism venture in Hawaii ? to be the president for audience and products, putting him in a position above Eric Bates, the former Rolling Stone editor who was brought on as a First Look editorial director, who is close to Taibbi.

The ¡°leave of absence¡± also comes three months after I first reported that Omidyar had apparently ordered Taibbi to change his strategy away from purely covering corporate fatcats (like, uh, Pierre Omidyar) to a wider mission, involving more comedy than reporting. Around the same time I heard rumors that Eric Bates was also unhappy at the organization.

I¡¯ve previously had a¡¦ uh¡¦ spirited email conversation with Taibbi about both claims, although Taibbi would only engage on the condition that his words were ¡°not for publication¡± ? a strange demand coming from an editor at a site that¡¯s about leaking confidential documents. I emailed Taibbi again today to ask if I can publish his responses in the light of today¡¯s news. He replied: ¡°No, you may not.¡±

Here then, for what little it¡¯s worth, is my side of the correspondence, from back in July, in which I laid out the state of First Look as I saw it (with a little help from some well placed sources.) The discussion was¡¦ uh¡¦ spirited on both sides. All words below are mine ? you¡¯ll just have to try to infer what Taibbi¡¯s stated position might have been.

A note on not for publication / off the record: I thought carefully about the ethics of publishing even my half of a ¡°not for publication¡± conversation. Given First Look¡¯s own policy of publishing confidential documents and the fact that it seems clear Taibbi wasn¡¯t being entirely truthful about his place at the company, I ultimately came down on the side of publishing my own responses, with Taibbi¡¯s words redacted. I¡¯m sure some readers with disagree ? I welcome the discussion.

Also, an important disclosure: Taibbi previously worked with Pando¡¯s Mark Ames on Russian ex-pat newspaper, the Exile. It has been widely reported that the two are no longer on speaking terms. I didn¡¯t discuss this post with Mark before publishing.

Ok, here are the emails¡¦

[The email thread began with Taibbi's emailing me to deny that Omidyar had changed his strategy. I had emailed First Look for comment on my story before publication but received no reply. Taibbi's email was headed """"Not for publication.""""]

From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Tue, Jul 29, 2014 [Redacted Taibbi quote, denying my story] Right, but that¡¯s not the part that seems to have changed. What¡¯s changed is that Omidyar¡¯s description of the site yesterday made zero mention of wall street. It¡¯s gone from finance first to politics first. More broadly, and happy to stay off the record, there¡¯s clearly something weird going on over there. Why does a 250m journalism project have to shift focus before it¡¯s launched? It suggests PO has no clue how to handle talent and so is retreating back to technology.

[Taibbi responded, with questions of his own. Here's my reply...]

From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Tue, Jul 29, 2014 I don¡¯t think [Omidyar] took you aside and ordered you not to cover his friends. I think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life, or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you over. Knowing what I do about his management style I¡¯m leaning towards the latter. But I emailed you because I actually want to understand what¡¯s going on.

[Taibbi responded again. And I replied again...]

From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Tue, Jul 29, 2014 [Redacted.] If I waited for Pierre and his staffers to respond to questions I¡¯d never publish a thing about First Look. I¡¯ve given PO 48hrs to respond before, and still got nothing. I¡¯m sure you¡¯ve always held stories indefinitely until you receive a response? As for your bizarre chain of straw man arguments ? I didn¡¯t say he¡¯d hired you to shut you up. So, no, I don¡¯t [believe] something you just made up. As you say, that would be real [redacted] analysis. Here¡¯s what I believe¡¦ I don¡¯t think Pierre has any idea why he hired you, and I don¡¯t think you¡¯re entirely sure either. Perhaps he was looking for names that looked good on a press release and you fit the bill. I think you¡¯re tired, and I think you knew the Rolling Stone gig wasn¡¯t going to last for ever. I think PO offered you complete editorial freedom and promised you a blank check to build your own team. For that reason, I think Omidyar¡¯s announcement yesterday should be terrifying to you, and to anyone else who works at FLM. He¡¯s lost his nerve ? for a combination of reasons ? and is retreating to something he understands: Technology and platforms. I¡¯ve spoken to people who have known Omidyar for decades and people who have worked with him on previous publications ? if you seriously think he¡¯s going to have your back when you go after his pals you¡¯re more naive than¡¦ well, than you are. I¡¯m tired of this conversation now. I honestly can¡¯t tell if you¡¯re being a team player, or if you believe any of this crap. I¡¯m sure I¡¯ll continue to cover FLM and I¡¯ll continue to ask for comment when I do. It¡¯s entirely up to you if you respond before publication or wait until afterwards and then bitch on Twitter. Either way, I¡¯ll continue to read your Wall St stuff if/when you publish it ? just as I read, and enjoyed, your most recent book on a long flight a few weeks back. Best of luck, Paul

[Taibbi responded again.]

From: Paul Carr To: Matt Taibbi Date: Wed, Jul 30, 2014 I¡¯m tired of it because you refuse to actually engage in conversation. I¡¯ve laid out my position, clearly and honestly, and asked follow up questions. You won¡¯t actually address any of my points ? you just keep lobbing back straw men and not engaging with what I¡¯m saying. At the very least you¡¯ve turned into a corporate flack for First Look: Continuing to hammer away at a caricatured version of what I said, while refusing to answer questions, and demanding that the whole thing stay off the record so that readers continue to be left in the dark. The last person who tried that line of attack over a Pando story was Lanny Davis. [Redacted] I¡¯ve told you what I believe, but I¡¯ll humor you ? and your enjoyment at playing PR flack ? by saying it again, this time line by line¡¦ [Redacted Taibbi quote] I think it¡¯s unlikely Pierre *ordered* you to stop writing about Wall Street. I¡¯d say the odds [are] almost zero. He¡¯s not that fucking stupid. Here¡¯s what I said ¡°No, of course I don¡¯t think he took you aside and ordered you not to cover his friends. I think either you made the decision yourself for reasons of an easier life, or his blog post was the first you heard about the change and he just publicly fucked you over.¡± Here¡¯s my question, which you don¡¯t seem keen to answer: Did you know Pierre was going to leave finance out of his post about what your editorial mission would be? If not, doesn¡¯t that worry you? If so, what is the reasoning behind not mentioning the thing that you are best known for but which is likely to make your sole funder and boss the most uncomfortable? A follow-up question: What are we to make of the fact that First Look journalists ? Greenwald in particular ? insist that Pierre has no control over editorial (indeed you¡¯ve insisted similar in this conversation) and yet he¡¯s the one laying out the company¡¯s editorial plan? Why wouldn¡¯t that be the job of the actual editors? Instead we have your $250m funder issuing a statement that marginalizes the one aspect of your work that might sting him while reassuring the world that ? don¡¯t worry! ? he intends to permit you and Greenwald to continue doing your jobs, but that he has decided to axe plans for all the other editorial sites he previously (in a video starring him) said he would fund. What does the phrase ¡°editorial independence¡± actually mean at First Look? [Redacted Taibbi quote] I think that¡¯s what he told you when you were first hired, yes. People are told lots of things on first dates. [Redacted Taibbi quote] I¡¯ve never said otherwise. That¡¯s a total red herring. [Redacted Taibbi quote] [Redacted] I didn¡¯t mention anything in my story about Pierre ordering you to stop writing (because, as I¡¯ve made clear, I don¡¯t believe that would make any sense); I didn¡¯t mention what I suspect you might have been told when you were hired (because, again, I don¡¯t know. What I know ? and what I wrote ? is that the public statements about your mission have changed); I didn¡¯t mention it being a satirical publication because that hasn¡¯t changed. [Redacted Taibbi quote] A press release about what your job and focus will be, written by the man who writes your pay checks and who is backing down on almost all of the editorial strategy that was in place when you were hired. A press release that was at odds with all previous statements about what your focus will be; specifically leaving out the one thing that would seem to have the potential to make Omidyar most concerned. Yes, I believe that means you will be focussing far less on that aspect of things and, yes, I believe that it¡¯s either a choice you¡¯ve consciously made, or a choice Pierre is attempting to make for you through passive aggressive public messaging. Your choice of denial is interesting. ¡°[Redacted]¡± That¡¯s the same line Greenwald used when he was challenged on whether he would write about Pierre¡¯s business interests. Clear enough to sound like a denial, but general enough to allow you to focus most of your energies away from Wall Street. Do you at least concede that previously the chief focus of your site was to be on finance and now it¡¯s on politics and ¡°culture¡±? If the *main focus* of the site still on uncovering financial corruption? Yes or no? If yes, why did your boss mischaracterize the site so badly in his blog post, and if no, why not? [Redacted Taibbi quote] Pierre has been interfering with First Look¡¯s editorial plans from the start. Every single editorial plan First Look has exists only at Pierre¡¯s pleasure. He is your sole funder and he is the one making public statements about how he intends to allocate those resources. How is it possible you understand Wall Street so well but don¡¯t understand that? [Redacted Taibbi quote] Yes, that is what¡¯s apparent from Omidyar¡¯s statement. [Redacted Taibbi quote] I had plenty of information, and printed what I knew, after giving you the opportunity to respond before publication. I¡¯d have plenty more information to set the record straight if you¡¯d answer any of the questions above. Or better still, stop hiding behind ¡°not for publication.¡± Why, if you¡¯re being so unfairly maligned, won¡¯t you let any of the above be shared with readers? Isn¡¯t the whole basis of First Look to make all the information public and let readers decide? Why doesn¡¯t that apply to conversations about First Look and its billionaire owner? Which leads me to my last question: Have you, or any first look staffer to the best of your knowledge, signed an NDA or non disparagement contract ? either as a standalone or as part of your employment contract(s)? You¡¯re right, this is an enjoyable conversation! Now let¡¯s shift it up a gear and get to some real answers. Paul

Despite previously saying he was enjoying our conversation, Taibbi stopped responding when I asked him he had signed any kind of contract restricting his freedom to talk openly about First Look.

When I emailed him earlier today, I asked if he had anything to add to his previous comments. He replied: ¡°Just that your story was wrong then and still is.¡±"
880,"Bloodthirsty militants in Iraq released a horrific video on Tuesday that shows the apparent beheading of American journalist James Wright Foley ? with the execution aimed at forcing President Obama to put an end to US airstrikes.

Foley, a 40-year-old photojournalist kidnapped in 2012, was forced to recite anti-American hatred from his Islamic State in Iraq and Syria captors as his final words before a masked killer put the knife to his neck.

The video ? which was posted on YouTube until the site yanked it down ? shows Foley dressed in prisoner orange and on his knees in the desert area. His head is shaved. Behind him is a man covered head to toe in black. It¡¯s titled ¡°A Message to America.¡±

¡°Any attempt by you, Obama, to deny Muslims liberty and safety under the Islamic caliphate, will result in the bloodshed of your people,¡± an Islamic State of Iraq and Syria terrorist says in reference to US airstrikes in Iraq.

A stone-faced Foley ? who was last seen on Thanksgiving 2012 while working for Agence France-Presse ? then bravely reads a clearly coerced statement.

¡°I call on my friends family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government. My message to my beloved parents: Save me some dignity and don¡¯t accept any meager compensation for my death from the same people who effectively put the last nail in my coffin,¡± he said.

¡°I call on my brother who is in the Air Force. I call on you, John. Think about who made the decision to bomb Iraq. Who did they really kill? Did they think about me you and our family when they made that decision? I died that day, John. When your colleagues dropped that bomb, they signed my death certificate. I wish I had more time. I wish I had the hope of seeing my family one more time.¡±

As a final insult, his last forced words were, ¡°I guess all-in-all I wish I wasn¡¯t American.¡±

The video then shows another American ? Time journalist Steven Joel Sotloff ? and the group says he is next unless the US backs off.

He is being held by the collar as he kneels in the desert, also wearing prisoner orange and a shaved head.

Sotloff was abducted in Syria in August 2013. His last Tweet was about his hometown Miami Heat.

¡°The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,¡± the masked man says.

White House National Security Council Spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said they¡¯re analyzing the video of the beheading to determine its authenticity.

¡°If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends,¡± Hayden said.

ISIS had warned the US of the potential murder in an earlier video saying, ¡°We will drown all of you in blood¡± in retaliation for US airstrikes that have been pounding them.

Several senior U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the situation said the Islamic State very recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge crushing airstrikes over the last two weeks against militants advancing on Mount Sinjar, the Mosul dam and the Kurdish capital of Irbil.

US Rep. Peter King (R-NY) said the video reveals ISIS for the true murders they are.

¡°ISIS is the worst of the worst,¡± King said. ¡°These guys are truly animals.¡¦ We have to go after them and destroy them.¡±

Foley family friend Holly Rene, who lives in their hometown of Rochester, NH, told The Post, ¡°These savages have got to be stopped. It¡¯s coming West.¡±

She said the family is ¡°falling apart with grief.

¡°I was just so hopeful Jimmy had, if they weren¡¯t going to get any good news, that he would have been dead for a long time now and there was no suffering involved. And to think he went through two years just to have this ending, it¡¯s beyond belief.¡±

Foley¡¯s family had set up website to plead for Foley¡¯s return ? and urged patience on Tuesday.

¡°We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers,¡± the Find James Foley Facebook wrote: ¡°Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.¡±

Foley, one of five children, had been captured previously in Libya for 45 days in 2011.

He graduated from Marquette University in 1996 and later studied journalism at Northwestern University.

He penned a letter to Marquette Magazine thanking the community for its prayers when he was captured in Tripoli with two colleagues. He recounted getting to call his mother from prison and learning of the university¡¯s prayer vigil for his release.

¡°If nothing else, prayer was the glue that enabled my freedom, an inner freedom first and later the miracle of being released during a war in which the regime had no real incentive to free us,¡± Foley wrote. ¡°It didn¡¯t make sense, but faith did.¡±"
882,"The British Islamic State militant who has featured in videos featuring the execution of Western hostages, known as ¡®Jihadi John¡¯, has been identified.

The man is Mohammed Emwazi, a young British man from West London who was known to British security services.

Security agencies did not disclose his name earlier due to operational reasons.

Emwazi is thought to have killed American journalist James Foley in a video released last August.

He is further believed to have featured in the videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, British taxi driver Alan Henning, and US aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, also known as Peter.

Emwazi is reported to have links with a former UK control order suspect who fled to Somalia in 2006 and has alleged links to the funding of militant group Al Shabab, which recently threatened to carry out terror attacks on London¡¯s Oxford Street.

He is a computing graduate from Queen¡¯s Park in West London, who traveled to Syria in 2012 and later joined the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS).

One of his friends told the Washington Post he had ¡°no doubt¡± that ¡°Mohammed is Jihadi John.¡±

¡°He was like a brother to me ¡¦ I am sure it is him. There was an extremely strong resemblance. This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person,¡± he added."
883,"There may be yet another bug in iOS 8, Apple's latest version of its mobile operating system for iPhone and iPad. This time, some users are reporting that anybody trying to reset the settings on their iPhone could accidentally delete all of their documents saved in iCloud, Apple's online backup service.

MacRumors reports that multiple users of its forums have reported an issue when attempting to reset all settings on their iPhone. Apple informs you as you reset your phone settings that """"no data or media will be deleted,"""" but people are claiming that the reset wipes all of their iCloud Drive documents.

The existence of the bug is not yet confirmed. We asked Apple for comment but have not yet heard back.

iCloud Drive is Apple's online file storage solution for documents. According to the official Apple site, iCloud Drive can be used to """"safely store all your presentations, spreadsheets, PDFs, images and any other kind of document in iCloud."""" It competes with DropBox and other cloud storage apps.

Forum posts claim that after they complained that a settings reset deleted their files as well, Apple told them the company is waiting on engineers to fix the issue. Another reported that his account was placed in troubleshooting mode as Apple investigated.

One poster on the MacRumors forums has this to say about the problem:

Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud. I have public beta of Yosemite so can't roll back via time machine. I have no pre iOS 8 backups in iTunes or iCloud to revert to (well iCloud device backups don't contain cloud documents and I should have iOS 7 backups in iTunes but can't find any. iCloud has no trash like dropbox. They seem gone forever.

885,"An asteroid about 60 feet in diameter missed hitting Earth Sunday by about 25,000 miles, as predicted by NASA¡¯s Near-Earth Object program.

It did not, contrary to some reports Monday, break off a little piece that landed with a bang in Nicaragua.

That story was intriguing to asteroid watchers, including the scientists at the Tucson-based OSIRIS-REx project, which tweeted Monday:

#Nicaragua impactor: the second serious impact in as many years that was undetected #chelyabinsk

NASA officials, though, are skeptical that the reported explosion and crater near Managua¡¯s airport was caused by a space object.

On Tuesday, the OSIRIS-REx twitter feed was reporting that skepticism.

It pointed to an article by Bill Cooke, lead for NASA¡¯s Meteoroid Environment Office, who wrote on NASA¡¯s ¡°Watch the Skies¡± blog that someone would have surely seen the meteor streaking toward Managua, which has a population of more than 2 million.

¡°... the lack of fireball reports from the surrounding populated area seems to suggest some other cause. The skies were partially clear, and an object capable of producing a crater this large would have also generated a very bright fireball (brighter than the Full Moon) that should have been seen over a wide area.¡±

Steve Larson, of Tucson-based Catalina Sky Survey, said the Managua explosion was also out of sync with the passage of asteroid 2014 RC, which was first spotted and observed by the sky survey¡¯s telescopes on Mount Lemmon on Sept. 1.

The asteroid made its closest approach on Sunday at 11:30 a.m. Tucson time. The Managua impact was reported 13 hours before then, Larson said.

It would have been a good story ? if true.

Rich Kowalski, the Catalina Sky Survey astronomer who found 2014RC, had previously spotted two other small objects that later struck Earth, in 2008 and again last January.

No one else has done that and this would have been his third one. 

At OSIRIS-REx, where scientists are planning a NASA mission to capture and return pieces of an asteroid they have named Bennu, asteroids that could turn into meteorites are big news.

In addition to bringing back pristine space rocks, the mission also promises to increase scientific knowledge of asteroids and the impacts of various forces on their trajectory ? good things to know should we ever need to defend ourselves from a predicted approach.

Dante Lauretta, principal investigator for OSIRIS-REx, said the first tweet about the Managua impact was a little embarrassing, but was quickly countered by skeptical ones.

He said the mission wants to be immediate and newsy with its social media, but also needs to apply """"some scientific rigor."""""
886,"Chinese parents who don't have the money to pay for treatment for their critically ill daughter have gone onto the street to try and raise the money by selling their son who is the girl's twin.

Mum Meng Xiangyan, 29, said that she and husband loved both of their children, but with certain death awaiting their daughter unless they could get medical treatment, they were prepared to sell their son to a good home so that both would have a chance of life.

Pictures published in local media show her standing on Weihai Road in Qingdao, which is a major city in eastern Shandong Province, Eastern China, with a placard offering to sell him to the highest bidder.

He was eating what appeared to be candied fruit and standing alongside his mother as she appealed for someone to come forward and buy the boy.

She said: """"Up until a year ago we had a wonderful family and we thought we had everything we could need with a wonderful little boy and a wonderful little girl who are twins.

""""But all that changed when my daughter was diagnosed as suffering from leukaemia in August of last year and we spent all of our savings and borrowed everything we could from friends and relatives. It still wasn't enough, and now we are hoping to raise cash from the sale of our son.""""

Medics say that the child is suffering from  acute lymphoblastic leukemia and needs urgent medical treatment that includes chemotherapy every 10 days at the Rizhao Municipal Hospital.

The family have sold up their apartment and everything in it and are now living in a tiny 10 square metre flat close to where the therapies are being carried out. The parents are also struggling to heat the tiny apartment which is vital to prevent the child, weakened by chemotherapy, from suffering in the cold which could be fatal.

Their attempt to sell their son follows on from a similar story only recently in which a woman was spotted trying to sell her baby daughter on the streets of China in order to pay her husband's ?10,000 medical bill.

Ni Qiong was photographed roadside in Fuzhou, southeastern China, with a written sign imploring pedestrians to purchase her one-year-old daughter.

She and her husband, Zhou Xinggui, are both migrant workers, but he is currently in hospital needing surgery after falling off scaffolding.

Despite remaining on the street for four hours, no pedestrians offered to purchase her daughter.

His wife's sign read: 'Please buy my daughter. My husband is waiting for surgery fees in the hospital as his boss ran away. I would like to sell my daughter and save my husband.'

According to That's Magazines, she was also in possession of another poster that stated: 'Boss fled after industrial accident and we don't have the money for treatment. I'm willing to sell my child to save her father.'

Many locals who witnessed her in distress were sympathetic to her plight.

Although some gave her money, no-one offered to purchase her daughter in the four hours she sat in the street with the sign, the magazine reported."
887,"Every superhero has an origin story, but one Russian boy¡¯s unbelievable tale isn¡¯t from a comic book ? it¡¯s very much real-life.

Twelve-year-old Nikolai Kryaglyachenko was walking home from school one day when he stopped to lean against a lamppost.

Unfortunately for Nikolai, the lamppost had a faulty wire and the schoolboy was blasted across the street by a jolt of electricity.

¡°When I came round, I felt groggy, but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened. When I woke up the next day and got out of bed, I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body. Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest,¡± Nikolai revealed.

Being a comic book fan, Nikolai immediately set about testing his new power, which is eerily similar to the power wielded by Marvel character Magneto.

¡°I can do things I couldn¡¯t do before, but I don¡¯t have a lot of control over it. Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things. Once I even attracted a glass ? it just moved towards me,¡± he said.

Naturally, Nikolai¡¯s schoolmates were fascinated by his new power, but what they didn¡¯t know was that he could pass his ability to others, turning them into human magnets, too.

¡°I could even hang a ladle on my nose,¡± said classmate Vika Balandina.

Nikolai is not the first real-life Magneto. In fact, an entire Russian family got magnetism superpower in 1987.

A year after the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, Leonid Tenkaev, his wife, Galina, their daughter Tanya and grandson Kolya were all able to stick metal objects to their bodies, according to The Guardian.

When they discovered their powers, Russian and Japanese scientists examined the family and verified that their seeming magnetism was real.

¡°There is absolutely no doubt that the objects stick as if their bodies were magnetic,¡± said Dr. Atusi Kono in 1991.

Another famous real-life Magneto revealed herself at a Superfields conference of 300 ¡°human magnets¡± in 1990.

Lucy Somers told The Associated Press on Saturday that she learned of her 33-year-old brother's death from FBI agents. There was no immediate comment from Washington.

Lucy Somers said: """"We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace.""""

However, Yemen's defence ministry released a statement claiming that armed forces early on Saturday freed """"an American hostage"""" being held by al-Qaeda and killed 10 members of the militant group holding him, Reuters reported.

Luke Somers was abducted in September 2013 in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. This week, the Pentagon confirmed it launched an earlier failed raid to rescue him.

Somers' reported death comes as a Yemeni security official said a suspected US drone strike at dawn Saturday killed nine alleged al-Qaeda militants in the country's southern Shabwa province.

900,"A hoax story alleging the British graffiti artist Banksy has been arrested and has had his identity revealed has once again duped thousands of people online.

According to the highly refutable website National Report, a 'news' website consisting entirely of fake stories, the artist was arrested by Metropolitan Police at his studio and his identity revealed as 35-year-old Paul Horner, originally from Liverpool.

The article contains all the elements you would expect to see from a news story covering an arrest, including details from police and quotes from those close to Banksy.

However, it only takes the bare minimum of fact-checking and research to spot that this story is a hoax.

The article claims the story has been confirmed by the BBC (it hasn't) and that City of London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy's arrest (he never did and Edwards doesn't even exist).

US news site CNN also did not conduct an interview with Banksy's """"project manager"""" John Hawes following his arrest (also because he doesn't exist).

The 'revealed identity' of Banksy is also suspicious.

Paul Horner is the name given to a Facebook spokesperson who said the site will soon be charging users $2.99 a month ? another hoax story that comes around every now and again ? as well as the name from a hoax story about a 15-year-old Louisiana teen who was sentenced to 25 years to life after he called a SWAT team to another teenager's house after he beat him while playing Battlefield 4.

The article is also said to have been written by Dr Darius Rubics, a fake name for a writer who claims to have be a Pulitzer-prize winning reporter but who, unsurprisingly since his previous stories include 'Obama Declares November National Muslim Appreciation Month' and 'Dennis Rodman Leaves US To Talk With Leaders Of Isis', has never been awarded any prizes for excellence in journalism.

One final, major clue that the story is a hoax is that the exact same thing has happened before. Last February, a fake press release that again claimed Banksy has been arrested and again claimed his name is Paul Horner did the rounds, with Jezebel being one of the more high-profile websites to publish the hoax before later taking it down.

Despite this, the latest 'Banksy arrested' story has been shared more than 200,000 times on Facebook and Twitter, proving there are still people who will believe anything they read on the internet.

902,"A Jordanian government spokesman has denied rumours that the Jordanian King Abdullah II, a trained pilot, is personally conducting airstrikes against the Islamic State (Isis).

Mohammed al-Momani said in a statement that reports about the personal involvement of the King in combat missions on IS targets is unfounded and baseless.

Rumours on King Abdullah spread after the he promised to fight back hard against IS, saying that the death of Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh """"will not be in vain"""".

""""We are waging this war to protect our faith, our values and human principles and our war for their sake will be relentless and will hit them in their own ground,"""" he said on state television.

Momani had revealed earlier that Jordan will intensify its efforts with an US-led coalition against IS.

Later on Wednesday, Abdullah vowed """"relentless"""" war against IS, saying Jordan will """"hit them on their own ground"""".

Iraqi news outlets cited unofficial sources saying that the king was personally flying a plane. Jordanian author Waleed Abu Anada tweeted:

BREAKING: Local reports here in Jordan say that King Abdullah will personally fly and lead the airstrikes against ISIS tomorrow. #IAmMoath? Waleed Abu Nada (@waleedabunada) February 4, 2015

Before becoming king, Abdullah II was a general in charge of Jordanian special forces and a certified Cobra Helicopter pilot. In 1980 he joined the UK's Royal military academy Sandhurst.

After the barbaric video of Kasasbeh burning to death emerged, The Royal Hashemite Court's Facebook page published a picture of the King in pilot gear:

The picture was retweeted several times and used by some as a proof that the Jordanian king was gearing up to fight IS in person.

Detailed Analysis

 
Report Claims McDonald's To Stop Serving Overweight Customers
According to a 'news' report that is circulating via social media and the blogosphere, McDonald's has decided to stop serving its products to overweight customers in a move designed to fight against growing obesity rates.

Supposedly, the fast food chain will implement the new policy on January 1st 2015. The report explains that scales will be installed in front of each register and customers will have to stand on the scales before ordering. Customers who weigh-in higher than Macdonald's pre-determined weight standards will not be served, claims the report.

Report is False - McDonald's Has Not Announced Such a Policy
However, the story is - of course - a work of fiction.  McDonald's has certainly not announced any plans to implement such a policy.

908,"ISIS supporters are circulating images of a child they say has become the youngest foreign fighter to be killed in battle for the jihadist group, according a counter-extremism think tank.

The images, which cannot be independently verified, show a young boy believed to be about 10-years-old holding guns, posing with a balaclava stretched across his face and standing alongside a man thought to be his father who is reportedly a militant.

Those sharing the pictures are paying tribute to the child on Twitter as the youngest martyr from the Arabian Peninsula to have been killed in Syria as Isis tries to establish a caliphate across swathes of the region, according to Charlie Cooper, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation.

Mr Cooper said the images have been circulated on social media with hashtags translated as 'martyrdom of the cub of Baghdadi and his father'. It is claimed that reports of his death first emerged on 26 September and that he was killed fighting alongside his father.

The child's alleged death comes after an Australian man fighting for Isis posted a picture online showing his young son holding the severed head of a Syrian soldier in August, with the caption: """"That's my boy.""""

In the same month, a report by the United Nations Human Rights Council found Isis affiliated groups have recruited, trained and used children in active combat roles.

It also found Isis has established training camps to recruit children into armed roles, where they would receive weapons training and religious education. In Raqqa, children as young as ten were being recruited and trained by Isis.

She said the patient was taken to the hospital's main campus, where he being treated appropriately for his illness and is responding well in good condition. The man had one of the symptoms of Ebola and had recently traveled to Nigeria.

The symptoms of the disease can include a high fever, diarrhea, vomiting, bleeding and bruising.

Local health officials have said it's extremely unlikely that the patient has Ebola.

Family members with patients in the emergency room at Research Medical Center said it was business as usual there on Sunday.

Hamele said Research Medical Center has standard infectious disease precautions, and is well-equipped and well prepared to implement them.

""""As health care providers, our job is to care for sick patients and we will continue to provide high quality care to our community as we always have,"""" Hamele said.

Harvin said she's not really afraid about Ebola.

¡°Dawn of Libya, an organization consisting of militants from several organizations, announced that it had claimed the embassy, which has been evacuated for a month. The group posted a video showing men playing in the embassy¡¯s pool.¡±

Libya is the same country that was the site of the Benghazi scandal that still, though generally has been reduced to distant thunder, is hovering over the Obama administration. The attack took the life of US Ambassador Chris Stevens, U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith, and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty.

Reports indicate, that a major Libyan airport in Tripoli was overrun terrorists, and 11 planes went missing last month. Magharebia reported on August 20 about the missing Libyan planes.

¡°The Tripoli airport siege led to the disappearance of several commercial planes. Now countries on both shores of the Mediterranean are worried about how the missing aircraft might be used by terrorists.

Rival militias have fought for control of the airport since mid-July, inflicting civilian casualties and extensive damage. But one unusual consequence of the ongoing battle has nearly a dozen countries on edge.¡±

Now, US intelligence suggests one or more of 11 planes from Tripoli, Libya could potentially find their way to New York and Washington D.C. According to the Washington Free Beacon, one official stated ¡± We found out on September 11 what can happened with hijacked planes¡±. The official went onto to say:

¡°The official said the aircraft are a serious counterterrorism concern because reports of terrorist control over the Libyan airliners come three weeks before the 13th anniversary of 9/11 attacks and the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi.¡±

¡°The air forces of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Mauritania, Spain, France, Portugal, Italy and Malta will participate in the upcoming exercise, in co-ordination with US naval forces stationed in the Mediterranean and Italy, Anatolia news agency reported on Monday.¡±

An analyst named Yakoub Mustafa told Magharebia:

¡°These terrorist elements are present in abundance in Libya and have gotten sophisticated weapons by buying them from smugglers, professional armed militias or even ordinary citizens. This volatile situation requires security partnerships among multiple countries¡±

The question remains, how should the US respond to escalation of attacks overseas?

LONDON: """"Jihadi John"""", the masked ISIS militant apparently responsible for the beheading of western hostages, was Thursday named as London man Mohammad Emwazi by the Washington Post and the BBC.

Britain's Metropolitan Police would not confirm the report, which identified the suspect as Kuwaiti-born Emwazi, who grew up in west London.

""""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation,"""" said Richard Walton from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command.

Contacted by AFP, the interior ministry could not immediately comment on the reports.

The Guardian and the BBC both reported the identity, without citing their sources.

British media had previously suggested """"Jihadi John"""" could be a different British jihadi.

Emwazi, in his mid-20s, was identified to the Washington Post by friends and others familiar with the case, with one close acquaintance telling the paper: """"I have no doubt that Mohammad is Jihadi John.""""

The suspect is from a middle class family and earned a degree in computer programming before traveling to Syria around 2012, according to the report.

He apparently became radicalized after being detained by authorities following a flight to Tanzania and being accused by British intelligence officers of trying to make his way to Somalia.

""""Jihadi John,"""" named after Beatle John Lennon due to his British accent, is believed to be responsible for the murders of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, British aid workers David Haines and Allan Henning and American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig.

He also appeared in a video with the Japanese hostages Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, shortly before they were killed.

In the videos posted online, he appears dressed all in black with only his eyes exposed, and wields a knife while launching tirades against the West.

Following the appearance of the report online, UK-based terror expert Shiraz Maher tweeted """"Well, that's it. The name is out. Jihadi John has been identified as Mohammad Emwazi.""""

British intelligence officers estimate that there are around 500 homegrown militants fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq.

924,"What¡¯s wrong with building a snowman? Plenty if you ask a scholar of Islam in Saudi Arabia. A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric apparently issued a religious ruling, officially called as a ¡®Fatwa¡¯, forbidding the building of snowmen. According to the cleric the practice is highly anti-Islamic.

The religious scholar, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid strongly believes that building snowmen isn¡¯t an acceptable Islamic practice and it should cease with immediate effect. The leader confirmed his viewpoint on a website where one of the members had asked whether it was OK for fathers to build snowmen for their children. To this, the cleric replied in the negative, saying,

¡°It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.¡±

Sheikh Munajjid had an explanation ready to back his fatwa. He argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being. Under the Saudi kingdom¡¯s strict interpretation of Sunni Islam, such an action is considered a sin. While noting his ruling, he added,

¡°God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,¡±

In simpler terms, the cleric was OK with building snow figurines representing anything non-human or animals for that matter. As amusing as it might sound, children might now be left with other ¡°inanimate¡± objects only. How does one have fun building a snow sculpture of a tree, isn¡¯t what the religious leader pondered much upon.

Fortunately for the children, the fatwa hasn¡¯t been accorded a date of implementation and moreover, no local government authority has officially confirmed or denied the same. Apparently, any cleric in Saudi Arabia is entitled to issue a fatwa. However, they are to strictly base their rulings on the teachings of Islam and must have valid basis under Saudi law.

The country¡¯s northern regions have been recently lashed by multiple snowstorms leaving in their wake sporadic accumulations of snow that will soon melt away. Despite being the second hottest country in the world snow has covered a few upland areas of Tabuk province near Saudi Arabia¡¯s border with Jordan for the third consecutive year as cold weather swept across the Middle East.

928,"ISIS terrorists have released a video purportedly showing the beheading of American freelance photojournalist James Wright Foley who went missing on Thanksgiving Day in 2012.

Foley, a 40-year-old New Hampshire native, was kidnapped at gunpoint from an Internet caf? in Syria. ISIS has threatened that Steven Sotloff?another freelance reporter who has been missing since August 2013 and has written for numerous publications such as Time, Christian Science Monitor, and Foreign Policy?will also be executed depending """"on Obama¡¯s next decision"""" regarding U.S. military strikes against ISIS in Iraq.

In the graphic video, Foley was forced to read a letter encouraging Americans to rise up against his ¡°real killer¡±?¡°the U.S. government,¡± adding that the U.S. airstrikes against ISIS ¡°hammered the final nail into [his] coffin.¡± Apparently, his executor was heard in the video speaking English with a British accent."
931,"The Lebanese army says it has detained the second wife of the Islamic State (Isis) leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and their eight-year-old son near the Syrian border.

The arrest reportedly took place in the past week and followed information provided by western intelligence agencies in the past fortnight.

Lebanese security officials described the woman as a ¡°high-value catch¡± and said the identity of the boy was confirmed through DNA testing. If so, the revelation would support the claim of international involvement. The US and other states have samples of Baghdadi¡¯s DNA from the nine months he spent in US custody in Iraq in 2004.

The British Foreign Office said it had nothing to add to the reports.

Analysts in Iraq said that, if true, the arrest would not necessarily yield useful intelligence. The self-styled leader of the new Islamic caliphate, which covers part of eastern Syria and Iraq, operates in an exclusively male world where women are rarely empowered. Baghdadi is believed to have three wives, two of them Iraqi and one Syrian.

¡°It is close to impossible that she would have operational details,¡± said an Iraqi intelligence officer. ¡°But she could still be useful on things like locations.¡±

Baghdadi is known to move frequently across Iraq¡¯s north-west, where he has been the target of an intensive technical effort to track him by the US National Security Agency and Britain¡¯s GCHQ. He uses trusted couriers to pass vital information, often in written letters, or repeated orally. The FBI has put a $10m (?6.4m) bounty on Baghdadi¡¯s head.

Al-Safir, the Lebanese news magazine, which first reported the arrest, said the woman and her son were arrested near the restive border town of Arsal and were being detained at Lebanon¡¯s military headquarters in the hills overlooking Beirut.

The woman was identified as Saja al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi, by a Lebanese security official and a senior political source. Dulaimi was one of 150 women released from a Syrian government jail in March as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 nuns taken captive by al-Qaida-linked militants in Syria, according to media reports at the time.

The arrest could be used as a bargaining chip against Isis, which has captured many foreign, Iraqi and Syrian prisoners. There was no immediate reaction on Isis websites, but in a possible Isis reprisal at least six Lebanese soldiers were killed on Tuesday by gunmen from Syria who attacked an army patrol near the border.

Isis continues to pose a mortal threat to Iraq¡¯s central government and to the opposition and regime in Syria where a devastating civil war is nearing its fourth year. The Iraqi and Syrian militaries have tried to mount counteroffensives against the group in past weeks, with mixed success. However, neither they nor US-led air strikes have wound back the spectacular gains the group enjoyed from June to August when it rampaged through northern Iraq as the Iraqi army withdrew.

Meanwhile, Isis supporters released a video claiming responsibility for a shooting that wounded a Danish citizen in the Saudi capital of Riyadh last month.

The video posted online by the Al-Battar Media Foundation shows a gunman pulling up beside a vehicle and firing five times at the man in the car, identified as Thomas Hoepner. The video¡¯s authenticity could not be confirmed but it was posted on a website commonly used by militants.

Saudi security officials say a Danish man was shot while driving November 22, and that he was treated for shoulder wounds. They did not release his name.

If confirmed, the shooting would be the first attack on foreigners in the kingdom carried out by IS supporters. About a decade ago, al-Qaida militants seeking to topple the Western-allied monarchy launched a wave of attacks that killed scores of security forces and Westerners in Saudi Arabia.

The video also includes audio clips of IS group leaders calling on supporters to launch attacks inside the kingdom.

In Brussels, Danish Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard told reporters on Tuesday that ¡°the Dane is doing better.¡±

Denmark and Saudi Arabia are part of the US-led coalition conducting airstrikes against IS militants in Iraq and Syria."
932,"India is going through some serious public sector reforms under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. So not turning up for work for a quarter of a century is now not OK, as one civil servant found out recently.

India's Central Public Works Department (CPWD), in a press release dated Jan. 8, 2015, announced the dismissal of a senior electrical engineer employed by the department for 35 years. He only worked the first 10.

It sounds like the CPWD could use a bit of reorganisation. The employee stopped turning up for work in 1990, and an inquiry was launched in 1992. The department then seems to have forgotten about it for 13 years:

Charges were clearly established six years ago, but Verma apparently remained in employment for another eight years until he was sacked today. It's not clear from the press release whether he was paid over the whole period. In 2014, a German civil servant admitted he hadn't done any work in the last 14 years, but Verma beats him by a decade."
933,"Islamic State militants released a video on Tuesday purporting to show the beheading of American journalist James Wright Foley, who has been missing since he was kidnapped in northwest Syria on November 22, 2012. Foley was abducted by unknown gunmen outside a cafe in Binesh, along with his translator, who was later released.

Another captive is shown at the end of the video. He is identified as Steven Sotloff, an American journalist who has been missing since August 2013.

The video has not yet been independently verified. The video and images were released on Twitter by user @mujahid4life. The account has since been suspended.

A freelancer known for his work covering conflict in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Libya, Foley had contributed work to GlobalPost, Agence France-Presse, and various other outlets. In 2011, he was kidnapped and held by pro-Qaddafi forces in Libya before being released after 45 days.

""""Captivity is the state most violently opposite his nature,"""" his friend Clare Morgana Gillis, a journalist who had been kidnapped with him in Libya in 2011, wrote in a piece last year for Syria Deeply. """"But when we were detained in Tripoli, Jim automatically turned his energies to keeping up our strength and hope.""""

In the video, the man identified as Foley delivers what appears to be a prepared statement.

""""I call on my friends, family, and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the US government,"""" he says. """"For what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality.""""

He goes on to decry the American aerial operation in Iraq, and ends by saying, """"I wish I could have the hope of freedom and seeing my family once again. But that ship has sailed. I guess all in all I wish I wasn't American.""""

A masked militant attired in black stands beside him. 

""""This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country,"""" the militant says, brandishing a knife in his left hand. """"As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards the Islamic State. You have plotted against us and gone far out of your way to find reasons to interfere in our affairs. Today your military air force is attacking us daily in Iraq. Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims. You are no longer fighting an insurgency. We are an Islamic army, and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide. So effectively any aggression towards the Islamic State is an aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic caliphate as their leadership. So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.""""

The video then shows the militant begin to cut the man's throat with the knife before fading to black, followed by a graphic image of his body.

The militant then appears standing beside the man identified as Sotloff.

""""The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,"""" he says."
936,"Islamic State (Isis) militants in Mosul may have contracted Ebola, according to Iraqi media reports of suspected cases at an IS-controlled hospital in the city.

The government and Kurdish media reported that militants were displaying symptoms similar to those of Ebola. The World Health Organization has not been able to confirm this but has offered assistance to Iraqi officials.

Iraq's official pro-government newspaper, al Sabaah, said Ebola arrived in Mosul from """"terrorists"""" who came """"from several countries and Africa"""", reports Mashable.

However, it is uncertain if any IS recruits came from the Ebola-hit regions of West Africa. Most have come from Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Egypt, Algeria, Sudan and Somalia.

A number of other illnesses could be to blame for the fighters' symptoms. Malaria, Lassa fever, yellow fever and the Marburg virus could all be confused with Ebola as they can also cause fever, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.

IS, a group that has been known to dismiss some aspects of science and modern medicine, recently executed a number of Iraqi doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat militants. UN workers have also been prohibited from entering their territory, an intelligence analyst who specialises in Iraq told Mashable.

938,"A group of ISIS militants in Iraq have allegedly gone to a local hospital to be treated for what is believed to be Ebola.

Three local media outlets reported this week that a number of ISIS fighters have shown signs of the deadly disease and were taken to a hospital in Mosul to be treated. The reports are currently unconfirmed, but the World Health Organization says that they are investigating the claims and that they are attempting to reach out to officials in the area to offer help.

¡°We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola,¡± WHO¡¯s director of communications Christy Feig told Mashable in a statement.

Feig reportedly went on to acknowledge that, despite their best efforts to offer help to area officials, if Ebola has in fact reached them, having an impact in an ISIS-controlled area could prove to be challenging.

Ebola reached epidemic levels last year in parts of Africa, and fear that the virus would spread in the United States took over the headlines for weeks this past fall. However, so far, the disease has yet to make any serious impact in the states.

Iraq¡¯s pro-government newspaper al Sabaah claims that the disease has spread to Mosul through ¡°terrorists¡± coming from ¡°several countries¡± in Africa.

Symptoms of Ebola include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, bruising, and severe bleeding, but any of those ailments could be attributed to a number of other conditions, so it¡¯s not entirely clear if the reported Ebola diagnoses are accurate.

939,"The ¡°Jihadi John¡± killer who has featured in several Islamic State beheading videos is Mohammed Emwazi, a Briton from a middle-class family who grew up in London, the BBC and the Washington Post newspaper reported Thursday.

WHAT THE VIDEOS SHOWED

In videos released by Islamic State, the masked, black-clad militant brandishing a knife and speaking with an English accent appears to have carried out the beheadings of hostages including Americans and Britons. He was made famous in a video showing the death of American captive James Foley in August of last year.

In each beheading video, he is dressed entirely in black, a balaclava covering all but his eyes and the ridge of his nose. He wears a holster under his left arm. Hostages gave him the name John as he and other Britons had been nicknamed the Beatles, another was dubbed George.

WHAT THE WASHINGTON POST AND BBC ALLEGE

WHY DID HE JOIN ISLAMIC STATE?

The Post quoted friends of Emwazi, who spoke on condition of anonymity, as saying they thought he had started to become radicalized after a planned safari in Tanzania following his graduation from the University of Westminster in London. They said Emwazi and two friends ? a German convert to Islam named Omar and another man, Abu Talib ? never made it to the safari. On landing in Dar es Salaam, in May 2009, they were detained by police and held overnight before eventually being deported, they said.

No comment was immediately available from the University of Westminster.

941,"It's hardly a secret that Amazon wants to be your go-to store for everything, but despite it's big pushes for same-day delivery there's still nothing like trudging into a physical store when you need something in a rush. Amazon seems to understand that all too well -- according to reports from CNBC and the Wall Street Journal, the e-commerce titan is gearing up to open its first brick-and-mortar store in midtown Manhattan in time for the holidays.

The move might seem a little out of character for a company like Amazon, but this isn't the first time it's thought about moving off of the internet and into meatspace. Two years ago, rumor had it that Amazon was going to open a physical shop in Seattle devoted to Amazon-exclusive books and its slew of Kindle gadgets. Oh, and who could forget those Amazon lockers you could choose to route your goodies to? Amazon's vision for its role in the real world has evolved a bit since then -- the Journal notes that the New York outpost could act as a way to highlight its own products like Fire TV, but the bigger draw is the space's role as a same-day product pickup location/customer service hub. Think about it: you'd be able to purchase something from Amazon and schlep down to the store on 34th Street to pick it up. Not exactly what you expected? You'd be able to return it to that very same spot. That sense of physical immediacy is something that Amazon has always lacked -- now we'll just have to wait and see if it's enough to warrant opening more of these things.

944,"(CNN) -- A company whose video chat service apparently captured audio of Michael Brown's shooting said Thursday the recording was created at the time the Missouri teenager was killed this month.

The revelation from Glide appears to bolster a man's claim that he inadvertently recorded audio of gunfire at the time a police officer shot and killed the 18-year-old Brown in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson on August 9.

The video was created at 12:02:14 p.m. that day, Glide said. Brown, who was unarmed, was shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shortly after noon.

""""A Glide user living nearby was simply using the Glide app on their smartphone exactly as it was designed -- to instantly communicate with a friend through our real-time video texting service. Simultaneously, they also captured audio in the background of the gunshots allegedly fired at Michael Brown,"""" the company said.

The sounds could be a piece in the larger puzzle of what happened during the shooting, which spurred days of protests in the city of 21,000.

Police have said Brown was trying to grab the officer's gun. Witnesses say the teen was holding his hands in the air when he was fatally shot. Investigators are determining whether to accuse the officer of wrongdoing; no charges have been filed.

The FBI obtained the audio and interviewed the man who made the recording, said Lopa Blumenthal, a lawyer for that individual.

The man, who asked that his identity not be revealed, lives near the site of the Brown shooting and happened to be using the application at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.

In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.

The significance of the pause

Witnesses and a friend of Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led to Brown's death, and the pause could be key in the investigation. But it's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports.

Ferguson police have alleged that Brown robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting, and that he and a friend, Dorian Johnson, were walking down a street when Wilson approached them in a police car.

Police say Wilson stopped Brown not because of the theft, but because Brown and a friend were blocking traffic. Wilson tried to exit his vehicle but Brown pushed him back into the car, according to a preliminary investigation, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said.

Read the police reports

Brown assaulted the officer while Wilson was in the car, and a shot was fired inside the police car during a struggle over the officer's gun, Belmar said.

Johnson disputes that, saying Wilson -- while sitting in the car -- started the scuffle by grabbing Brown by the neck, and that Brown tried to pull away. Johnson also said that there was no struggle for the gun, but rather that Wilson drew the weapon and shot Brown once at the car.

Johnson said Wilson shot Brown again as the teen ran away. According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting.

But a woman who identified herself as a friend of Wilson called in to a St. Louis radio show with what she said was the officer's version of events.

The caller, who identified herself only as """"Josie,"""" said Brown -- after going away from the vehicle following the first shot -- turned around, taunted the officer and charged at him. Her account matches what Wilson has told investigators, a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation told CNN.

An autopsy showed Brown had six gunshot wounds.

Attorney Chris Chestnut told CNN this week he was surprised by the gap in shots.

""""It's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless -- he has no weapon,"""" said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell.

Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer. That incident occurred in North Carolina.

But if the gunfire heard on the audio is from the Brown incident, the pause doesn't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.

""""To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,"""" said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN's """"Crossfire."""" """"Maybe the officer will say, 'Well, I fired and he kept advancing, so I fired again.' """"

The movie, based on Walter Isaacson's 2011 biography on Jobs, is named after the Apple idol for a reason. The Jobs character is going to dominate the screen.

""""The role is an extremely difficult role. He has more words to say in this movie than most people have in three movies combined,"""" Sorkin said. """"There isn't a scene or frame that he's not in, and there's a tremendous amount of language.""""

Bale is a good actor, and he has just the right balance of prickliness and genius to nail Jobs. But who is filling the Woz role? Sorkin didn't say. My vote is for Jonah Hill (if the real Woz isn't available, of course.)

Danny Boyle is set to direct, meaning we have an Academy Award-winning screenwriter, director, and actor on board. Meaning this movie might be awesome.

950,"Iraqi pilots who have joined Islamic State are training its members in Syria to fly three captured fighter jets, according to a UK-based activist group that monitors the conflict.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said witnesses had seen the planes being flown around a military airport in Aleppo.

Meanwhile, Iraqi forces have launched an attack on IS militants near Tikrit.

The city was among the areas in Syria and Iraq seized by IS this year.

Rami Abdul Rahman, head of the SOHR, said IS was using Iraqi officers who were pilots under ex-Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to train fighters in Syria.

""""People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,"""" he said.

It is not known how many Iraqi pilots have defected.

Witnesses told the SOHR the planes appeared to be MiG-21 or MiG-23 models.

The BBC's Sally Nabil in Baghdad says IS has three planes which it captured earlier from the Syrian military in Aleppo and Raqqa.

US Central Command spokesman Col Patrick Ryder told Reuters the Pentagon was """"not aware"""" of IS conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere.

Aleppo became a key battleground in the fight between Syrian rebels, which now include IS, and government forces after the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011.

New coordination

Separately, the Iraqi government said its troops had gained ground to the north and west of Tikrit and cut an important IS supply route.

Correspondents say that past efforts by the government to regain territory in the area have ended in failure.

Meanwhile Kurdish forces, backed by US-led air strikes, are continuing to fight militants in the northern Syrian town of Kobane.

US-led warplanes struck IS positions on Friday, taking advantage of new coordination with the town's Kurdish defenders.

The BBC's Kasra Naji, on the Turkish-Syria border, said the day began quietly but there had since been around six strikes.

On Thursday, Kurdish commander Baharin Kandal told the BBC that the militants had been driven out of most of Kobane.

Our correspondent says refugees watching their town from a hilltop nearby agree that there are only two or three neighbourhoods that are still the scene of fighting.

The battle for Kobane, which is also known as Ayn al-Arab, is regarded as a major test of whether the US-led coalition's air campaign can push back IS.

Activists say more than 600 people have been killed since the jihadist group launched its assault on the mainly Kurdish town a month ago.

More than 160,000 people have fled in the face of the IS advance.

Capturing the town would give the group unbroken control of a long stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border.

IS fighters have gained a reputation for brutal tactics, including mass killings and beheadings of soldiers and journalists."
951,"THE beheading of American journalist, James Foley, at the hands of ISIS militants shocked the world but forensic experts have revealed the video was probably staged, with the murder happening off camera.

The UK Times reported that an international forensic science company, which has worked for police forces across Britain, said there is no question Foley was beheaded but that camera trickery and post-production techniques look to have been used.

¡°I think it has been staged,¡± said one expert in visual forensics, after he was commissioned by The UK Times to examine the footage.

¡°My feeling is that the execution may have happened after the camera was stopped.¡±

Aymenn al-Tamimi, a fellow at the Middle East Forum think-tank, said over the years ISIS militants have improved the production quality of their videos.

The analysis by experts has highlighted a number of inconsistencies that could suggest that the beheading of Foley, which was seen on the video, was not his actual death.

Firstly, no blood can be seen, even though the knife is drawn across the neck area at least six times. Secondly, sounds allegedly made by Foley do not appear consistent with what may be expected.

The forensic analysis expert said that no incision could be seen on Foley¡¯s neck, though the right hand of the jihadist partially blocked the shot.

While the forensics company, which asked to remain anonymous, did not reach a definitive answer they did conclude that at some point an execution of Foley did take place.

This comes as a heartbreaking last letter from Foley to his family has been revealed on the Free James Foley Facebook tribute page.

While Foley was not permitted to send the letter, a fellow hostage, Danish photographer Daniel Rye Ottosen, memorised it word for word.

The 25-year-old spent 13 months imprisoned with Foley and when released in June his first call was to Foley¡¯s mother, Diane, where he dictated every word.

Foley describes fond memories with his family and how he and the eighteen other hostages being held with him are coping.

¡°I know you are thinking of me and praying for me. And I am so thankful. I feel you all especially when I pray. I pray for you to stay strong and to believe. I really feel I can touch you even in this darkness when I pray,¡± Foley said in the letter.

¡°I have had weak and strong days. We are so grateful when anyone is freed; but of course, yearn for our own freedom. We try to encourage each other and share strength. We are being fed better now and daily. We have tea, occasional coffee. I have regained most of my weight lost last year.¡±

Foley goes on to describe his hopes of attending his sisters wedding and his plans to take his grandmother out when he returns home.

¡°Grammy, please take your medicine, take walks and keep dancing. I plan to take you out to Margarita¡¯s when I get home. Stay strong because I am going to need your help to reclaim my life.¡±

The full letter can be read here.

Yesterday, British security services MI5 and MI6 reportedly identified a British hip-hop artist as the key suspect in the hunt for the killer who beheaded American journalist James Foley.

The Sunday Times newspaper said Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, from Maida Vale in West London, had become a crucial part of the investigation.

The paper attributed the information to ¡°senior government sources.¡±

Bary, 23, is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trial on terror charges in New York tied to the deadly 1998 bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

Former hostages held by ISIS have said he is one of several jihadists they nicknamed ¡°the Beatles¡± due to their British accents, with two of his cronies referred to as ¡°George¡± and ¡°Ringo.¡±

Bary ? who recently tweeted a photo of himself holding up a severed head ? was among three Brits identified as possibly being the masked killer known as ¡°John¡±.

In June, The Sunday Times revealed a threat made by Bary on Twitter. ¡°The lions are coming for you soon you filthy kuffs (infidels),¡± he wrote. ¡°Beheadings in your own backyard soon.¡±

Bary, who went to Syria last year to fight in its bloody civil war, has a build, skin tone and ¡©accent all similar to those of ¡°John,¡± according to The Telegraph.

Before becoming a jihadist, he was an aspiring rapper known as ¡°L Jinny,¡± whose music was played on BBC Radio 1.

Bary also appeared in music videos posted on YouTube for songs titled Overdose, Flying High and Dreamer.

But he was reportedly radicalised by followers of firebrand ¡©Islamic preacher Anjem Choudary and walked out of his family¡¯s plush West London home last year, saying he was ¡°leaving everything for the sake of Allah.¡±

Earlier this month, he was seen in a photo posted to Twitter wearing camouflage clothing and a black balaclava while holding a severed head with his left hand ? the same hand ¡°John¡± is seen using to draw a knife across Foley¡¯s throat in his execution video.

Also under investigation are Abu Hussain Al-Britani, 20, a computer hacker from Birmingham, and Abu Abdullah al-Britani, in his 20s, from Portsmouth, the MailOnline reported.

Mail Online reported that al-Britani was jailed in 2012 for stealing personal information from former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Since joining ISIS¡¯ brutal campaign in Syria al-Britani, real name Junaid Hussian, has worked to fund the ISIS war chest by mounting jihadist cyber attacks on British banks and celebrities.

Abu Abdullah Al-Britani, meanwhile, is active on social media using Twitter to post pro-ISIS propaganda. According to Mail Online, he is believed to be behind an account on the ask.fm social media site giving young people advice on how to travel to Syria and Iraq and encouraging them to join the jihad.

Other possible identities for ¡°John¡± include the brother of a British doctor once charged with kidnapping two Western war correspondents, and a former gang member who converted to Islam and travelled to Syria, Britain¡¯s Telegraph newspaper reported.

A dozen American counterterrorism experts are expected to fly to the UK ¡°within days¡± to help identify Foley¡¯s killer, the Daily Mail reported.

956,"BAGHDAD ? The Islamic State (IS) has been accused of using chlorine gas against Iraqi soldiers who were besieged in Anbar province. Survivors of an Iraqi army regiment in Saqlawiya, near Fallujah, say the radical group used the gas against the besieged soldiers. There were conflicting government statements about whether the gas had been used.

The siege on the regiment, which consists of nearly 400 soldiers, has created an uproar in Iraq, with Iraqi members of parliament (MPs) on Sept. 21 demanding the government break the siege. 

The following day, the Anbar Operations Command said it opened the road to Saqlawiya, ending the siege of the soldiers. These statements seemed to be an attempt to ease the anger of MPs and the public at security leaders for leaving the soldiers besieged without any support.

The incident came shortly after the massacre in the Speicher military base in Tikrit, where nearly 1,700 Iraqi air force cadets were killed. The investigations are still ongoing, as the victims¡¯ families continue protests, blaming security leaders for failing to protect the lives of the cadets.

The testimonies of the survivors from the Saqlawiya incident, which were posted on YouTube, have shown the extent of negligence on the part of security leaders toward the soldiers, as well as the lack of serious attempts to save their lives as the siege lasted five days. The biggest surprise in the testimonies was that IS has chlorine gas and used it against the besieged soldiers.

The MP in Qadisiyah province south of Baghdad held a news conference in the Iraqi parliament, during which they blamed Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi in his capacity as commander in chief of the armed forces. The soldiers who hail from the province have suffered from the neglect of military leaders, in spite of repeated appeals seeking protection for the service members.

MP Ali al-Badri said, ¡°Three hundred soldiers were killed in Saqlawiya."""" Badri, citing survivors¡¯ testimonies, said, ¡°Terrorists used chlorine gas for the first time.¡±

Sabah al-Jouburi, a professor at Salahuddin University in Salahuddin province, said IS had used chlorine gas in its war against the army for the first time.

Reports previously suggested IS has over the years obtained chemicals to be used in its war against the Iraqi government seize cities. Hisham al-Hashimi, an expert on terrorist groups, pointed Al-Monitor to ¡°the use of chlorine gas by the group [now known as IS] in 2005, in the bombings of a popular market in Abu Ghraib.¡±

Hashimi said, """"In early 2014, IS was able to obtain large quantities of chlorine gas when it took control of water treatment plants in Fallujah and Saqlawiya, and in Mosul and Salahuddin following the fall of Mosul on June 10.¡±

Yet, Hashimi said it appeared that IS had not used chlorine gas ¡°in any direct or indirect fighting¡± with the army. He said IS knows the gas is not that toxic, ¡°can only kill in enclosed places, and loses its effectiveness when heat is generated from the explosion. It can only be used to induce intimidation.¡±

¡°Experts have not been able to prove its use in the battles of southern Dalouiya and Saqlawiya,¡± he added.

Anbar police also said that chlorine gas had not been used on the soldiers in the province.

While Maj. Gen. Ahmad Saddag al-Dulaimi, Anbar¡¯s police chief, told Al-Monitor by phone, ¡°We heard news that IS used chlorine gas in the Anbar battles,"""" he said, """"This news is unfounded, and chlorine gas has not been used during the battles at all.¡± He added, ¡°If it indeed had happened, we would have told all media outlets about it and announced it.¡±

On the other hand, the Iraqi Ministry of Defense said, ¡°Terrorist organizations used chlorine gas in some areas close to water treatment plants, but did not have an impact. For the gas to have a lethal effect, it should be used in mass quantities, which the enemy does not currently have.¡±

Although the ministry asserted that ¡°no injuries were reported for now in the regions where the organization used chlorine gas,¡± it issued instructions ¡°for the purpose of increasing security measures.¡±

In a statement obtained by Al-Monitor, the ministry advised the members of the armed forces and civilians to ¡°cover their faces with a wet cloth to protect themselves from the potential effects [of chlorine gas]¡± in case they hear IS is using it."

He apparently originally declined the operation when told it would cost ?300, but quickly changed his mind.

Vet Faye Bethell used anaesthetic water to knock the goldfish unconscious before clearing blockages with the intricate procedure.

""""He was constipated because he had a lump blocking his bottom, rather than because of his diet or any other reason,"""" she told the BBC.

The lucky pet, which is a member of the carp family, survived the 50-minute operation before going home with his owner. Bethell used a small heart rate monitor to ensure the fish was sufficiently drugged before using a mini-scalpel to remove several blockages near the anus and dorsal fin.

A Vogue employee told Gawker that the new offices are infested with rats. And the problem is apparently so bad that the editor-in-chief is reportedly refusing to enter the premises.

Wintour, 65, has allegedly informed her staffers that the vermin must be removed before she clicks her dainty heels into their new home.

The staff member told Gawker the most pressing dilemma facing them had to do with fashion: 'A serious concern (laughable but I guess it makes sense) is all the clothing that could get nibbled through.'

962,"A British fighter who travelled to Iraq to stop the Islamic State claims the terror group fed a murdered kidnap victim to his own mother after she went to their headquarters and demanded to see him.

Yasir Abdulla, a security guard from Keighley, West Yorkshire decided to go to Iraq and fight against ISIS after hearing they came within six miles of taking control of his home village in Kurdistan, which he left in 2000.

It has been reported that the 36-year-old bought a set to combat fatigues online for ?100 before going to Kurdistan and buying an assault rifle.

From Yorkshire to Iraq: Security guard Yasir Abdulla (left near his home and right patrolling the border of his home town of Sheikhan, Iraq) joined hundreds of fighters trying to stop the spread of ISIS

He then joined hundreds of other Kurdish and Peshmerga forces who are trying to stop the spread of ISIS by patrolling a ten-mile front line in Iraq.

Mr Abdulla returned to the UK last week but told The Sun how an elderly Kurdish woman, whose son was captured by ISIS and taken to Mosul, went to meet the jihadis to try and secure his release and was then fed his body.

Slaughter: Mr Abdulla with a member of ISIS who he said was killed after he beheaded a Kurd

The father of four told the newspaper: 'She was determined to find her son and went to ISIS headquarters and asked to see him.

'The ISIS men told her to sit down because she had travelled a long way and said she should have some food before they took her to meet her son.

'They brought her cups of tea and fed her a meal of cooked meat, rice and soup. She thought they were kind.

'But they had killed him and chopped him up and after she finished the meal and asked to see her son they laughed and said """"You've just eaten him.""""'

During his time on the front line, Mr Abdulla revealed how ISIS are terrorising locals by calling them and threatening to kidnap them and bury them alive unless they surrender.

He also told of how the terror group kill prisoners they capture by throwing them on a 'human bonfire' and that he saw his own cousin killed in an ISIS attack.

But despite returning back to his family in Yorkshire, Mr Abdulla is keen to go back to Kurdistan saying he wants to finish the job in defeating ISIS.

The new details about the cruelty of ISIS come as Iraq's prime minister called on tribal fighters to abandon the jihadis ahead of an offensive to retake Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit from extremists.

Haider al-Abadi offered no timeline for an attack on Tikrit, 80 miles north of Baghdad, which fell into the hands of ISIS last summer.

ISIS and Al Qaeda are hiding messages to their followers in digitally-altered eBay photos and even pornography, a book claims.

Investigative journalist Gordon Thomas said Al Qaeda has used the tactic of 'steganography' - concealing messages in audio clips or images widely available online - to encode items listed for sale on the auction site.

It works by manipulating a sound waveform or the order of pixels in a small or invisible part of an image, a process not unlike the way teletext used to be delivered on analogue TVs.

Now Israeli intelligence service Mossad believes ISIS militants are doing the same, according to Mr Thomas.

One intelligence source told him messages are often hidden on Reddit or 'X-rated pornographic pictures which conceal documents and orders for the next target'.

The claims are contained within new chapters of Mr Thomas' book Gideon's Spies, an extract of which was published yesterday by the New York Post.

However, Shiite militias and Iraqi security forces have stationed themselves around Tikrit as state-run media has warned that the city 'will soon return to its people.'

Tikrit, which occasionally saw attacks on U.S. forces during the American occupation of the country, is one of the biggest cities held by ISIS.

It also sits on the road to Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, which is also held by the extremists.

It has also been revealed that in February alone, violence across Iraq killed at least 1,100 Iraqis, including more than 600 civilians, according to the the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq.

UN envoy Nickolay Mladenov blamed the deaths on the extremist group, government forces and pro-government Shiite militias.

He explained: 'Daily terrorist attacks perpetrated by ISIS continue to deliberately target all Iraqis.

'There also concerning reports of a number of revenge killings by armed groups in areas recently liberated from ISIS.'

Last year was the deadliest in Iraq since its 2006-2007 sectarian bloodshed, with a total of 12,282 people killed and 23,126 wounded, according to the UN.

964,"Doctor in besieged Syrian town reports arrival of patients with blisters, burning eyes and breathing difficulties after explosion

Kurds battling Islamic State militants for control of Kobani fear the extremist group may have used an unidentified chemical weapon, according to officials and one of the few doctors still working in the besieged Syrian town.

Patients with blisters, burning eyes and breathing difficulties turned up at a clinic after a blast was heard on Tuesday evening, Dr Walat Omar said. He described the symptoms as abnormal and said he could not identify their cause, but suspected a chemical weapon.

¡°After a loud explosion [on Tuesday night], we received some patients with abnormal symptoms. They reported a bad smell which produced some kind of allergic reaction,¡± Omar said in a telephone interview that was periodically disrupted by heavy explosions.

¡°Some had red patches and blisters on their skins, others had difficulties breathing and others were vomiting, with painful throats, and others with burning eyes and noses. There was one patient, all his body was covered in red patches and blisters.¡±

Islamic State (Isis) is thought to have obtained stocks of ageing but still potent chemical weapons when it seized Iraqi army bases where they were stored, the New York Times reported earlier this month.

In June, the group took control of a sprawling complex that had been the heart of Saddam Hussein¡¯s chemical weapons programme, Al-Muthanna State Establishment. There may also have been chemical weapons buried or abandoned elsewhere, that were not destroyed by US forces or the Iraqi military.

Stocks manufactured before 1991 are dirty, corroded and not always easy to identify or use, but can still cause serious injury.

Iraqi officials said 11 police officers were poisoned by chlorine gas last month, when Isis fighters used it to attack the Iraqi town of Duluiya. All the officers survived.

That attack was hundreds of miles from Kobani, near the Syrian border, where Omar said he feared eight civilians had been injured by some kind of chemical attack.

Intense fighting has made it impossible to get doctors the equipment they need to do definitive tests for the use of chemical weapons, but Omar said they displayed symptoms distinct from anything else he had treated in weeks of heavy battles.

He said he had ruled out chlorine gas or biological weapons, based on his medical training, but thought the injuries were caused by a chemical. Trained in Ukraine, he is originally from Kobani and returned there to work after seven years at medical school.

¡°This is the first time we have seen this kind of condition,¡± Omar said. ¡°I have seen other strange conditions but nothing like this before.¡±

The opinions of chemical weapons experts consulted by the Guardian were divided after seening a series of pictures provided by Omar of a young man with large skin blisters and a severely swollen lip.

The pictures did not have any metadata to confirm the time and place they were taken, but had not been published on the internet before Omar provided them to a Kurdish journalist.

One expert with personal experience of treating mustard gas victims said that, although the blisters were not typical, the symptoms overall were consistent with a possible sulphur mustard poisoning. That could only be confirmed with a urine or blood test.

Other experts said that while the symptoms could be consistent with exposure to a chemical agent, they were somewhat unusual and other medical conditions, such as a severe allergic reaction, would need to be ruled out.

Senior Kurdish politicians said they feared a chemical attack, and had asked for testing kits to seek confirmation.

¡°Many people were injured ¡¦ and showed symptoms of chemical weapons use: choking, breathing difficulties, bleeding eyes, burning skin etc,¡± said Idris Nassan, deputy foreign minister of the Kobani administration. ¡°Some of the doctors say that it might be phosphorus or poison gas of some kind, but the investigation is ongoing, we don¡¯t know for sure.¡±

It is possible that Isis fighters could mistake some chemical munitions for ordinary weapons and use them without being aware of what they are handling. It could also be harder to evaluate the impact of attacks using partially degraded weapons, one expert said.

¡°Various factors might contribute to far milder symptoms than those normally associated with mustard agent exposure under combat conditions. These could include impure or degraded agent, short-term exposure, or exposure to a limited volume of agent,¡± said Jean-Pascal Zanders, a former analyst with the chemical and biological warfare project at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

The bomb believed to have caused the injuries treated by Omar exploded at about 10pm in west Kobani, near a hospital. Omar said he thought Isis may have targeted the medical centre to try to undermine morale, although it was not being used and none of the forces defending the city were in the area.

¡°Some fighters were further away, they complained about their eyes watering and burning, and pain in their nose,¡± he said, estimating that around 20 of them were affected but needed only basic first aid.

Regarding civilians who were closer to the blast, Omar said he was treating affected patients with oxygen, the steroid cortisone and other drugs until about 2.30am, as well as fielding calls from people who did not want to leave their homes.

The three most seriously injured patients, who ranged in age from 17 to over 40, stayed in the clinic overnight for observation and Omar was trying to arrange for their evacuation to Turkey for further treatment.

One Kurdish activist said Kobani may have been hit by teargas for the first time, perhaps drifting across from a Turkish border village where police had been using it for weeks to break up crowds of demonstrators. It has not been deployed in the intense battles for Kobani and so would not be recognised by residents, although demonstrations nearest to the border have almost all been in daylight hours, while Omar reported victims arriving well after nightfall.

The 62-acre island, in Lake M?laren, Sweden, was the former home of the 14-time major winner and his ex-wife, Elin Nordegren, to whom he was married for six years.

It boasts six tee-off areas for a custom-made golf hole, features a secluded villa, a hunting lodge and its very own landing strip for propeller planes.

The island also includes a protected quay, private ferry boat, historic hill fort, pasture land for horses, stables and two small Skinnp?lsarna islands with a water area of around 500 acres.

However, potential buyers will have to bring their own clubs as the main building does not come with furnishing.

Sabine Rollinger, of Vladi Private Islands, which is listing the island, said: """"This island was owned by Tiger Woods, but after his divorce he doesn't need an island in Sweden any more.

""""This is a unique, exclusive private island with total privacy. It includes a private harbour, untouched woods, beautiful lush parks, open fields, striking lake views and a tastefully designed main residence, a mini-mansion.

""""Also on the island is a landing strip and six tee-off areas for golf practice. The secluded villa, hunting lodge and stables are located on the main island and surrounded by a very large lawn.

""""Here you can land your private prop airplane, play soccer, do some riding or enjoy unstructured golfing.

""""A hundred metres from the villa is the private, protected bay, and a 50-metre long quay that provides plenty of space for your own, and your friends' boats.

""""This is the place to begin great fishing trips in your own private fishing waters, take a boat ride out to M?laren's over 1,000 islands or the beautiful archipelago of Stockholm.

""""This island is also unique due to its central location as the Swedish capital is only about an hour away by boat or car, and from there you have swift access to the Stockholm archipelago.

""""The property even has a historical 11th century Viking stronghold, a dramatic landscape with approximately 30 metres high rocks rising out of the lake.

""""The island boasts a variety of wildlife, such as deer, hares and beavers - even elks can be seen on occasion.

""""The protected location, combined with the quay's generous dimensions, make it an ideal place for private parties and outdoor dining.

""""You go for a swim in Lake M?laren, where the water reaches temperatures of up to 26C in the summer.

966,"A meteorite landed """"like a bomb"""" just missing Nicaragua's main airport and raising concerns over scientists' ability to track space objects on potential collision courses with Earth.

Officials said they """"thanked God"""" there were no injuries as the rock landed in Managua, a sprawling city of 1.2 million people where it left a crater 12 metres (40ft) wide and five metres (16ft) deep.

The object was believed to have been a small part of the asteroid 2014 RC, nicknamed """"Pitbull,"""" which astronomers had been monitoring as it passed the planet.

Nasa currently tracks more than 11,000 asteroids that come relatively close to Earth but 2014 RC, which is the size of a large house, was only discovered on Aug 31.

It moved within 25,000 miles of the Earth's surface and had been projected to be at its nearest point over New Zealand on Sunday.

The meteorite that apparently originated from 2014 RC landed in a wooded area just before midnight on Saturday.

Its impact registered on instruments used to detect earthquakes, which regularly hit Nicaragua.

People living nearby head an an explosion and described seeing liquid, sand and dust blowing thought the air, and the smell of burning.

Jorge Santamaria, who lives near the airport, said: """"I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave.""""

Jose Millan, of the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies, said: """"We need to celebrate the fact that it fell in an area where, thank God, it didn't cause any danger to the population.

""""All the evidence that we've confirmed on-site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event.""""

Nicaragua said it would be asking for assistance from international scientists, including those from the United States, to investigate.

The composition of the meteorite has yet to be determined and it was not clear if it had disintegrated on hitting the ground or been buried under the ground.

Wilfredo Strauss of the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies, said: """"We are convinced that this was a meteorite. We have seen the crater from the impact.

""""You can see two waves on the seismic equipment). First, a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit Earth, and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound.""""

Rosario Murillo, Nicaragua's First Lady and Government spokeswoman, said the object """"appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.""""

In February 2013 a meteor that had not previously been detected by scientists exploded over Chelyabinsk in Central Russia, injuring more than 1,000 people.

Dr Dan Brown, an astronomy expert at Nottingham Trent University, said: """"The possible meteorite impact in Nicaragua, linked with the asteroid 2014 RC which flew by Earth raises some interesting questions.

""""Although the impact occurred roughly 12 hours before the asteroid passed Earth, that part of the planet was facing in the right direction for it to have been a fragment associated with it.

""""If it was an unrelated object, however, then it further demonstrates how we don't really monitor all the potentially dangerous rocks out there."""""

969,"(IraqiNews.com) On Monday several Members of Parliament from Diwaniyah Province confirmed that ISIS killed over 300 soldiers using chlorine gas for the first time in Saqlawiyah, north of Fallujah.

MP Ali al-Badri said, at a press conference at the parliament building in the presence of a number of deputies of Diwaniyah province and attended by IraqiNews.com that ¡°the terrorist organization ISIS used chlorine gas for the first time in the region of Saqlawiyah after trapping more than 400 troops, resulting in the deaths of many of them due to suffocation while the terrorist gangs detonated car bombs within the brigade headquarters.¡±

Badri said, ¡°We hold the full responsibility for the fate of the trapped soldiers to the Commanding General of the Armed Forces, Haider Abadi, and the security leaders, especially the Anbar Operations Chief, Lt. Gen. Rashid Flaih, because of the slow measures taken by the Air Force despite frequent appeals for rapid procedures to rescue the soldiers since several days ago.¡±

Badri added that the ¡°Saqlawiyah crime is considered as the second Speicher Massacre,¡± stressing that ¡°300 soldiers were killed in the attack.¡±

971,"Some 219 years ago, founding fathers Sam Adams and Paul Revere looked on as a bit of history was tucked into a corner stone of the Massachusetts State House. On Thursday, excavators carefully extracted the keepsakes, according to the Boston Globe.

The time capsule, contained in a 5-by-7-inch copper box, is thought to hold a collection of coins and other artifacts dating as far back as 1652. The capsule had actually already been extracted in 1855, when the original cowhide capsule was replaced with the metal box and new items, including coins from the 1800s, were added to the stash.The box had then been mortared inside the State House cornerstone.

Meghan Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Administration and Finance, told the Globe the box may also hold an engraved silver plate, newspapers, the seal of the Commonwealth, cards and the title page of the Massachusetts Colony Records.

Time Capsule Has Steve Jobs' Computer Mouse

It¡¯s believed to be one of the oldest time capsules ever recovered in the state ? and likely would have remained in place had it not been for concerns that water had been seeping into the State House at that particular corner. That inspection prompted officials to re-excavate the time capsule to investigate its contents and make sure the items are in good condition.

¡°Hopefully there will be no damage and we will be able to observe the artifacts that trace us back to the history not only just of this building, but of our Commonwealth and our country,¡± said Secretary of State William Galvin, who was on hand for the capsule¡¯s excavation, according to the Boston Globe.

As luck would have it, another time capsule was recovered in Boston just this past October. That 100-year-old capsule was extracted from its holding in the head of a golden lion statue that had perched atop the Old State House in downtown Boston. That capsule held sealed letters, photographs, and newspaper articles.

As for this most recently extracted time capsule, it¡¯s now being held in a safe at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. On Sunday examiners will X-ray the box and they plan to carefully open it and inspect its contents next week. After that, it will be returned to the State House cornerstone, perhaps with a few new items added for future generations to rediscover.

972,"KFC: Marijuana on the menu? Not likely. A story that began circulating on Tuesday afternoon created a bit of a frenzy, but the fact is, there¡¯s no sign KFC will really be selling marijuana in its stores.

The story began at the Racket Report, where it was announced that marijuana profits were hitting such high levels that the fast food restaurant chain had decided to get in on the game. While the idea may appeal to pot lovers who think they can get the munchies and a bucket full of munchables in a single stop, there are a few problems.

First and foremost, Racket Report appears to be a mostly satirical website, carrying multiple stories, such as the Fetal Ink Syndrome story, that have been debunked by fact-checking site Snopes. (Here¡®s Snopes debunking the Fetal Ink Syndrome tale.)

KFC also doesn¡¯t mention any marijuana sales on its official news page ? a thing you¡¯d think they¡¯d mention if they were hoping to drum up sales.

Another concern is banking. While marijuana shops were assured early in 2014 that they could have access to banks, many report still having difficulties. Though the original story claims that KFC¡¯s pot sales will be cash only, in order to protect the restaurant¡¯s funds, this would be no protection.

If marijuana sales are understood to be federally illegal (a question that is in limbo at the moment, with government officials calling on law enforcement to make pot arrests a very low priority, but laws still on the books) then no funds collected by a facility could reasonably be protected. That is, if the government elected to seize funds illegally procured, they could still freeze bank accounts and seize the contents ? even if all illegal dealings were handled in cash.

This could not only be a concern for KFC, but for its parent company, YUM Brands.

Notably, a KFC turned into a marijuana dispensary is a plot point in a South park episode, and there is another KFC that does indeed sell marijuana ? but it¡¯s not the fried chicken chain. Instead, it¡¯s a shop called Kind For Cures, a California pot shop based on that same South Park episode, that assures on its website, ¡°This ain¡¯t no chicken joint!¡±

Calls to YUM Brands and to KFC Tuesday evening were not immediately returned, but there are no signs that KFC marijuana will be available in the bucket next to your extra crispy any time soon.

974,"London, England ? The elusive graffiti artist, political activist, film director, painter and long time fugitive that for years has gone by the pseudonymous name of Banksy, was arrested early this morning by London¡¯s Metropolitan Police. After hours of questioning and a raid of his London art studio, his true name and identity have finally been revealed.

The City of London Police say Banksy¡¯s real name is Paul Horner, a 35-year old male born in Liverpool, England. The BBC has confirmed this information with Banky¡¯s PR agent Jo Brooks along with Pest Control, a website that acts as a handling service on behalf of the artist.

London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy and how Horner was finally apprehended after all these years on the run.

¡°We had a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force monitoring different groups where Banksy was known to frequent. We received word that around 2am a group of individuals left a flat speculated to be one of Banky¡¯s art studios. This group was followed by agents and once vandalism had occurred, we then arrested the group, 5 men total. These individuals all had ID on them except for one, and that is the one we believed to be Banksy,¡± Edwards said. ¡°We then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from. Inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism. We also found a passport and ID of a Paul Horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding.¡± Edwards continued, ¡°Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting. We are also holding the other four individuals whose names we are not releasing at this time.¡±

Horner was arrested by London Police in Watford, a town and borough in Hertfordshire, England, about 17 miles northwest of central London.

The graffiti artist that goes by the name Space Invader told reporters he does not agree with the arrest or outing of Banksy¡¯s identity.

¡°He¡¯s just doing art, spreading joy and making political statements the best way he knows how. That is what he was doing and I hope that is what he¡¯ll continue to do,¡± Invader said. ¡°For the London Police to setup some 24-hour task force just to catch Banksy is ridiculous. I hope we hear plenty of noise from the good tax-paying citizens of London about this.¡±

After today¡¯s arrest it is unclear who else will be sought in connection with Banksy¡¯s arrest. CNN spoke with John Hawes who is a project manager for Banksy says he is worried that charges could be brought against him also.

¡°If they spent this many man-hours and brought this many charges against Banksy, I can¡¯t imagine that he¡¯ll be the only one to go down in all of this,¡± Hawes said. ¡°All the beauty Paul Horner brought to this world, unfortunately the London Police just see it as vandalism and want to lock him up. It¡¯s such a shame.¡±

Banksy¡¯s identity was long speculated to be Robin Gunningham, a man born in Bristol, England in 1973. Known for his contempt for the government in labeling graffiti as vandalism, Banksy displays his art on public walls and even goes as far as to build physical prop pieces. He does not sell his work directly; however, art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder.

Police apprehended the famous street artist while in the middle of finishing a piece about a mascot for a Christian organization named Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin.

¡°I¡¯m just happy to be a part of this whole thing,¡± Fappy told CNN. ¡°I¡¯m not familiar with this Banksy character, honestly if it¡¯s not in the Bible I probably haven¡¯t heard of it, but if this arrest spreads awareness of the harmful effects of self-rape, then that is a good thing. Hopefully news of this ordeal will bring the much needed attention to the dangers and consequences of playing with your sin stick or ringing the Devil¡¯s doorbell. Hopefully, God willing, one day, masturbation will be illegal and people will finally be free of playing on the Devil¡¯s playground.¡±

Local resident 27-year old Matthew Williams told reporters he was disgusted when he heard news of the arrest.

¡°What a waste of taxpayers money. Wouldn¡¯t it be better spent fighting the war against drugs or violence ? What harm has this man done except produce beautiful thought provoking artwork? The counterfeit money thing has either been planted or its part if his art and not actual real counterfeit cash.¡± Williams continued, ¡°This is just another move by the Five-Oh to crush anything good and free. People need to work out what side they¡¯re on and if they¡¯re on the side of beauty and freedom, they need to start fighting back. There are simply not enough heroes like Banksy to do it for you. I hope this blows up in the cops¡¯ faces and the rest of the government as well.¡±

¡°People are taking the piss out of you everyday. They butt into your life, take a cheap shot at you and then disappear. They leer at you from tall buildings and make you feel small. They make flippant comments from buses that imply you¡¯re not sexy enough and that all the fun is happening somewhere else. They are on TV making your girlfriend feel inadequate. They have access to the most sophisticated technology the world has ever seen and they bully you with it. They are The Advertisers and they are laughing at you.You, however, are forbidden to touch them. Trademarks, intellectual property rights and copyright law mean advertisers can say what they like wherever they like with total impunity.

F*ck that. Any advert in a public space that gives you no choice whether you see it or not is yours. It¡¯s yours to take, re-arrange and re-use. You can do whatever you like with it. Asking for permission is like asking to keep a rock someone just threw at your head.

You owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don¡¯t owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don¡¯t even start asking for theirs.¡±

In 2011, Banksy was a no-show to accept his Oscar for his documentary Exit The Gift Shop, though his artwork was seen all over Hollywood in days leading up to the awards.

As soon as news of the arrest was made, the City of London Police say they began receiving dozens of phone calls from people either claiming to be Banksy, or claiming to be with him. As of 6 PM London time, hundreds of people were gathered outside the London Police Department chanting ¡°I¡¯m Banksy!¡± and holding signs demanding his release. Various local news stations have reported witnessing the crowd parting for a blind woman who attempted to turn herself into authorities claiming that she was in fact the real Banksy.

Horner was born in Liverpool is a city in Merseyside, England, on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary. Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of graffiti, public vandalism, criminal mischief, public indecency, resisting arrest, money laundering, criminal conspiracy and racketeering. More charges may follow. For anyone with more information on criminal charges that could be used against Horner, London working alongside the United States have setup a 24-hour hotline at (785) 273-0325."
975,"Brian Williams took a moment on Monday¡¯s ¡°NBC Nightly News¡± to push back on a social media dustup over a Saturday night liveshot that didn¡¯t quite happen. Mike Seidel appeared on camera Saturday night with his back turned, leading some to speculate the reporter may have been relieving himself.

No so, geniuses:

Social Media owes our friend Mike Seidel an apology. The intrepid and fearless Weather Channel Meteorologist was the victim of some wild misinformation when this happened on the news here Saturday night: Lester Holt threw to Mike¡¯s live report in a snowstorm in North Carolina. Mike had lost cellphone contact with our control room.. so he couldn¡¯t hear through his attached earpiece that he was on the air. He put his back to the storm and the camera.. he had to take off his gloves and re-dial his phone which was tethered to his ear, that¡¯s when the rumors hit the web that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow. It was just Mike working to make it right ? which is why we all love working with Mike Seidel."
977,"Supporters of Islamic State have claimed that an American aid worker held hostage by the militant group has been killed in a Jordanian air strike intended to avenge the burning to death of a captured Jordanian pilot.

A statement posted on a website sometimes used by Isis fighters and their supporters said that Kayla Mueller, 26, had been killed by a missile strike during a bombing raid by Jordanian planes on the Syrian city of Raqqa early on Friday.

Mueller died when rockets partially destroyed the building in which she was held, the statement said, adding that no Isis fighters were killed in the attack

Several pictures of a damaged building complex were included in the statement which they said showed the aftermath of the air strike, but the claim that Mueller had been killed could not be independently verified.

¡°The criminal crusader coalition planes targeted sites outside Raqqa city today at noon time while people were performing Friday prayers,¡± the message read.

¡°The raids continued on the same site for more than an hour. God has disappointed their endeavours and foiled their plot by not hitting any jihadi man thank God.¡±

The Isis communique used Mueller¡¯s full name and included her US contact details, which had not been made public by the media at the family¡¯s request.

Last week the militant group prompted outrage around the world when they released a video of Jordanian pilot Muadh al-Kasasbeh being burned to death.

In response, Jordan¡¯s King Abdullah vowed to step up his country¡¯s role in the US-led coalition against Isis, promising to wage ¡°relentless war¡± against the militant group which has taken control of a wide swath of Syria and Iraq.

Jordan announced that it sent tens of fighter jets to hit Isis targets in Syria on Thursday, including what they claimed were ammunition depots and training camps. Jordanian jets carried out a second wave of air strikes against Isis targets on Friday.

Jordanian officials seemed to cast doubt on the reports of Mueller¡¯s death. Foreign affairs minister Naser Judeh, said on Twitter: ¡°An old and sick trick used by terrorists and despots for decades: claiming that hostages human shields held captive are killed by air raids.¡±

State Department deputy spokesperson Marie Harf said she could not confirm the report, but said that ¡°a number of Americans¡± were being held by Isis.

Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said: ¡°We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports.¡±

¡°We have not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates Isil¡¯s claim,¡± she said, using another acronym for the group.

Mueller, originally from Prescott, Arizona, was seized by Isis fighters in August 2013 as she left a hospital run by the Spanish branch of Medecins San Frontieres in Aleppo.

The aid worker had traveled to the Turkish-Syrian border in December 2012 to work with groups providing support to Syrian refugees, a family spokesperson said in a statement.

She had spent the previous four years working for various aid groups in India, Israel and Palestine.

An unaffiliated citizens group in Raqqa who have proved reliable in the past told the Guardian they believed the claims of Mueller¡¯s death were true, based on comments by Isis fighters.

But given the extent of the damage to the building complex shown in the statement, it is unclear how other Isis fighters could have escaped alive unless the hostage had been left unguarded.

Unusually for Isis, the militants did not provide footage or photographic evidence of Mueller¡¯s purported death as it has done with previous hostages.

Over the past seven months, Isis has killed three American hostages: journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig. All three men were on camera, and video of their killings was posted online.

Two Japanese hostages, Haruna Yukawa and Kenji Goto, were killed in December, as were two British aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning.

John Cantle, a British journalist, is believed to still be in Isis captivity. Cantle has appeared in several Isis propaganda videos, the last of which was disseminated online in early January.

A second female western hostage is believed to remain in the hands of Isis militants in Syria. In contrast to the nine male hostages and Kasasbeh, neither Mueller nor the second female hostage have ever been shown on camera or in propaganda imagery distributed by the group.

Isis is believed to have previously released misleading reports on the fate of their captives. The group maintained that Kasasbeh was still alive throughout a prolonged ? and eventually fruitless ? attempt to negotiate a prisoner swap involving the two Japanese hostages and Sajida al-Rishawi, a would-be suicide bomber who had been on death row in Jordan since 2008.

The group¡¯s media outlets released the video of Kasasbeh¡¯s death on Tuesday, but Jordanian officials belief that he had been killed about a month earlier. Rishawi was hanged on Wednesday, hours after the video was released.

Mueller, who graduated from Northern Arizona University in 2009, had long made helping others a priority, according to the Mueller family spokesperson, who cited years of social welfare activities at home and abroad.

In a story in her hometown paper, the Prescott Daily Courrier, Mueller said she felt drawn to help after learning more about the situation in war-torn Syria.

¡°For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal. [I will not let this be] something we just accept,¡± Mueller said. ¡°It¡¯s important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.¡±"
978,"According to a news source from Taiwan, the mass production stage of the Apple Watch will not begin until January.
In addition to the delay in start of mass production, the G for Games blog also reported that the Apple Watch will instead be assembled by only one supplier, as opposed to the two suppliers that was previously rumored.
The information about the January start of mass production was revealed [in Chinese] by AppleDaily, which adds that the reported time frame of the start of mass production will make questionable Apple's statements that the Apple Watch will become available to the public by early 2015.
The Apple Watch was unveiled by Apple on Sept. 9, in the same event where the company unveiled the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. The device is Apple's first entry into the wearable technology market, wherein rivals such as Samsung and LG and startup companies such as Pebble have already established their presence.
In the event, Apple said that the Apple Watch will begin to be sold to the public in early 2015 without specifying a definite time frame. However, if Apple really does intend to release the device early next year, mass production should already have started.
AppleDaily's report of a January start date for the Apple Watch's mass production could mean that the delay was due to the suppliers that Apple tapped for the device.
Earlier rumors suggested that two suppliers will be assembling the Apple Watch, namely Quanta Computer and Inventec. However, AppleDaily's report specifies that Quanta will be the only supplier to Apple for the device, with Inventec being removed from the process due to reasons that have not been made clear.
Quanta has started its preparations for the mass production of the Apple Watch, increasing its workforce to a total of 4 million employees, reported G for Games. There is also said to be an agreement between Apple and Quanta that the Chinese supplier will not be manufacturing smartwatches for Apple's rival companies in the industry.
The delayed mass production start, coupled with the sudden departure of a supplier, will make it difficult for Apple to keep its promise of an early-2015 release for the Apple Watch.
The delay will only add to the conservative expectations that Piper Jaffray investment firm analyst Gene Munster has on the sales forecasts for the Apple Watch.
""""Overall, we believe that the Apple Watch is light years ahead of any other smartwatch on the market, but consumer application may be limited initially until developers begin to create useful applications for the watch,"""" Munster wrote. 
Munster forecasts 10 million Apple Watches sold in 2015, with a selling price of an average of $500."
979,"Celebrity Dog Cesar Millan should have died, according to a post on the site noticiasunam.com. But there are many obvious oddities in the post - Viral Inspector shows why it probably is fake.

TV Personality and hunduppfostraren Cesar Millan has died of a heart attack, reports the site noticiasunam.com . The news has been widely adopted - just over 17,000 interactions on Facebook accordance sharedcount.com - and shocked many. """"Oh, becomes so sad. Rest in paradise Cesar Millan! """"Writes one of many Swedes who have turned to Facebook to express their condolences.

But they probably unnecessarily. It is unclear what exactly noticiasumam.com is a kind side, but a reputable news source, it is at least not.

To begin with, there are many warning signs about the article itself if Millan's death. It is the Hispanic-side single article in English, and has under its byline written by Frank William Abagnale, a famous forger of checks whose lives laid the basis for the movie """"Catch Me If You Can"""". And whatever Abagnale do nowadays so it's probably not writing for noticiasumam.com.

Additionally, it stated the source of the claim to be a press conference with Millan's wife, Jahira Dar. Searches shows that this press conference is not mentioned anywhere else than right on noticiasumam.com, which almost certainly means that the conference never even took place. To make doubly sure is Jahira Dar and Cesar Millan not actually married, at least according to a mingling article in the Daily Mail from November 23. 

According to the article, Millan have been put in the hospital """"yesterday afternoon"""", ie on Tuesday. But the night of Wednesday, Swedish time appeared still up happy tweets and status updates on Millans Twitter - and Facebook feeds  - the last came as late as an hour before the site's article was published. Cesar Millan has a television program on the National Geographic, nor where there any information about his death.

If there are rumors about a celebrity death so you should always wait until they are confirmed by a close relative or associate of the person, in an interview with a credible source. In the case of Millan, there is no such confirmed data, and both Indian International Business Times  as Dutch De Telegraaf  warns that page that published the news is not credible.

Viral reviewer can therefore conclude that the source of the allegation of Cesar Millan's death is not credible. Although Millan's team have not directly denied the information we dare say he most certainly not dead. We have searched his team for comment."
981,"The Pentagon confirmed today that the U.S. killed Ahmed Abdi Godane, the leader of the al-Shabaab insurgent group in Somalia, in an airstrike this week.

U.S. special operations forces targeted Godane in southern Somalia in a Sept. 1 attack using manned aircraft and drones to destroy an encampment and a vehicle. It took several days to confirm initial reports that he died in the attack.

¡°The United States works in coordination with its friends, allies and partners to counter the regional and global threats posed by violent extremist organizations,¡± Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon¡¯s spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement confirming the mission¡¯s success.

Al-Shabaab, an offshoot of al-Qaeda, was declared a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department in 2008. Godane claimed responsibility for the attack last year on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya¡¯s capital of Nairobi, in which at least 67 people died. The U.S. has offered a $7 million reward for information on his whereabouts.

¡°Godane¡¯s removal is a major symbolic and operational loss to the largest al-Qaeda affiliate in Africa and reflects years of painstaking work by our intelligence, military and law enforcement professionals,¡± White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement.
Godane was among a number of ¡°high-ranking¡± al-Shabaab officials who were meeting at Dhaytubako, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) southwest of the capital, Mogadishu, when the attack occurred, Lower Shabelle Governor Abdulkadir Mohamed Nur said in a phone interview Sept. 2.

Suicide Bombings

In recent months, al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing in Djibouti that killed a Turkish national and wounded several Western soldiers as well a car bomb at the Mogadishu airport that targeted and killed members of a United Nations convoy, according to the statement.

Al-Shabaab was responsible for twin suicide bombings in Kampala, Uganda, on July 11, 2010, that killed more than 70 people, including one American. The group has also been responsible for the assassination of Somali peace activists, international aid workers, numerous civil society figures, and journalists.

(CNN) -- Gunmen opened fire at buses carrying students and soccer players in southern Mexico.

It's been more than a week since that violent night of shootouts in Iguala, Mexico. Authorities say three students were among six people killed in the September 26 violence, and 43 students remain missing.

Where are they? Authorities and witnesses fear they may be close to unraveling the mystery.

Along a dirt road in a remote part of Mexico's Guerrero state, authorities turned up unmarked graves full of human remains on Saturday.

Investigators found the remains of at least 28 people inside the graves, Guerrero State Attorney General I?aky Blanco Cabrera told reporters Sunday. The bodies were covered in gasoline and burned before they were buried, he said, and it could take between two weeks and two months to identify them.

A tip from suspects detained after the shootouts led them to the grave sites, authorities said.

The missing students, who were studying to become school teachers at Escuela Normal Rural de Ayotzinapa, were mostly young men in their 20s, according to a website state government officials have set up to help in the search.

""""Help us find them!"""" the website says, offering a reward of 1 million pesos ($74,000) for information leading to the missing students.

State officials, who've faced sharp criticism over the students' disappearance, released a statement Sunday detailing their investigative efforts. So far more than 30 people have been detained, including 22 local police officers.

The police have denied attacking anyone, according to a government statement on their detention.

But protesters from the school have said officials aren't doing enough.

""""NOW IT IS MORE DANGEROUS TO BE A STUDENT THAN A CRIMINAL,"""" one post on a Facebook page dedicated to the school said.

Witnesses have accused police of orchestrating and participating in the shootings.

""""The goal of the police was to kill any person that was inside the perimeter they had,"""" one student from the school told CNN en Espa?ol.

Guerrero state Gov. Angel Aguirre has defended his government's response and called for calm in the face of protests.

""""To the family and friends of those who were savagely massacred, I offer all my solidarity and support,"""" he said in a series of Twitter post Saturday. """"It would be highly condemnable, those who want to take advantage or politically profit from a situation like the one that today overwhelms and saddens us.""""

A bus carrying members of the third division Chilpancingo Hornets soccer club was also among those ambushed in what authorities described as three attacks on September 26. A 15-year-old player on the team was killed.

Omar Sanchez, one of his teammates, described the ambush to CNN en Espa?ol.

""""We were just watching a movie and we saw the bullets come in and then it was like we were going off a cliff and the bus tipped over. And it was then that they started firing at us with machine guns,"""" he said. """"It sounded so ugly, the gunshots and my teammates screaming, 'Help, leave us alone, we are injured.' A teacher said, 'you have already blinded me, please, we are the team from Chilpancingo.""""

The armed men said they weren't going anywhere, ordering the team to open the door.

""""Now you are going to be taken, we are going to kill all of you,"""" the gunmen said, according to Sanchez.

When the teacher refused to open the door, Sanchez said, the men opened fire again.

The case has left many troubling questions unanswered. Key among them: Who gave the orders to open fire, and what was their motive?

State prosecutors first said last week that the violence started after the college students commandeered three buses, and city police opened fire.

Since then, evidence has tied the Guerreros Unidos criminal group, and police connected with them, to the shooting and the students' disappearance, Blanco told reporters Saturday.

In 2013: 54 bodies found in mass graves in Mexico

For years Guerrero state, which includes Iguala and the well-known resort city of Acapulco, has ranked among the Mexican states with the highest homicide rates, a crime statistic regularly used by officials and analysts when discussing the overall security situation.

Figures released by Mexico's National Statistics and Geography Institute last year painted a grim picture of kidnapping throughout the country.

A survey revealed that there were more than 105,000 kidnappings nationwide in 2012, the institute said, but only about 1,300 of them were reported to authorities.

Doctors removed a matchhead-sized insect, believed to be a spider, from under Dylan Thomas¡¯s skin earlier this week and have sent the creature away for testing to determine what it is.

It had been there for three days and burrowed up to his chest, leaving a trail of red blisters.

The 21-year-old was on his first trip to Bali.

He told News Corp yesterday that doctors had pulled a tropical spider ¡°a bit bigger than the size of a match head¡± from his skin.

989,"Industry sources indicate Apple is planning to lean heavily on Samsung as a component supplier for both new iPhone 6 builds and the upcoming Apple Watch, reports BusinessKorea (via G for Games). If true, this would be a marked change from Apple's reported goal of lessening its reliance on Samsung by seeking alternative suppliers for critical hardware components.

According to the report, Apple is looking to Samsung to supply RAM, NAND flash storage, and batteries for future iPhone 6 production, supplementing or replacing current suppliers for those components.

NAND flash has been a particular area of concern for Apple according to recent news reports, with the company's decision to use cheaper and slower TLC (triple-level cell) flash memory for larger-capacity iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models being blamed for sporadic crashing issues. Apple has reportedly moved to stop the use of its current TLC NAND flash chips and supposedly is back at the negotiating table with the South Korean supplier.At first, Apple discussed with Samsung about the supply of NAND flash for the iPhone 6. Due to problems with prices, Toshiba's TLC NAND flash was used in the 128GB models, and components made by SK Hynix, Toshiba, and SanDisk were used in the 64GB models.

However, as overseas IT news sites reported functional defects in the 128GB models, Apple is said to be considering whether or not to replace the TLC NAND flash made by Toshiba with Samsung's own TLC NAND flash. If Apple and Samsung strike a deal, Samsung will supply both DRAM and NAND flash to the iPhone 6.Beyond the iPhone 6, the same Korean industry sources also claim Samsung will supply Apple with application processors for the Apple Watch, which is slated to debut in early 2015.

Apple touts the Apple Watch as using a new """"S1"""" module for the internals that seals nearly all of the internal components into a single resin-filled package for durability. The individual components of the S1 are undoubtedly being provided by several different manufacturers, but according to today's report the main application processor portion will be coming from Samsung.

991,"Islamist militants claim to have beheaded a man identified as James Foley, an American journalist kidnapped in Syria in late 2012, in a graphic video posted on the internet.
A spokeswoman for the White House said the intelligence community was trying to determine the video¡¯s authenticity. ¡°If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American

The video entitled ¡°Message to #America (from the #IslamicState)¡± purporting to show ¡°James Wright Foley¡± on his knees ahead of his execution by a man whose identity is disguised and who speaks with a distinct British accent.


At the end of the video, the same person holds up a second person, who is identified with a caption on the screen as Steven Sotloff, a journalist kidnapped in 2013, and says: ¡°The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.¡±
Last week, social media accounts controlled by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, or Isis, uploaded videos showing dozens of beheadings of individuals they accused of being sympathisers of the regime of Bashar al-Assad, President of Syria, in the northern Syrian town of Deir Ezzor.
The posting of the latest video by Isis comes days after President Barack Obama ordered an intensifying series of air strikes on the militants in northern Iraq.
The immediate aim of the strikes was to back Kurdish and Iraqi forces in their efforts to retake Mosul Dam, a strategic asset which the militants had gained control of in their recent military surge.
Mr Obama has said that Washington will not send troops to Iraq to engage Isis in combat but administration officials have expanded the US military mission there over the last week to halt and push back the militant¡¯s advance.
¡°We believe that Isis needs to be taken out,¡± Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said this week.
An estimated 500 Britons have travelled to fight with extremist groups in Syria ? most from London ? and almost all have joined Isis, according to UK security officials.
British intelligence believes that several have travelled into Iraq and that some have almost certainly been involved in the worst of Isis¡¯ atrocities.
The apparent murder of Mr Foley is a violent reminder of some of the most graphic crimes committed by Isis¡¯s predecessor organisation, al-Qaeda in Iraq, which gruesomely beheaded dozens of Iraqis and foreigners, uploading videos of the acts to the internet, under the command of the militant group¡¯s then leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, nearly a decade ago.
The beheading of American citizen Nicholas Berg in 2004 by Mr Zarqawi himself propelled AQI to the forefront of the war on terror and marked the beginning of a new particularly bloody phase in the Iraqi extremist insurgency in the wake of the US-led invasion.
AQI¡¯s other high profile victims included Americans Jack Hensley and Eugene Armstrong, Briton Kenneth Bigley and South Korean Kim Sun Il.
Mr Zarqawi was killed in northern Iraq in 2006 in a US air strike, and AQI was subsequently driven underground by a surge in American troops in Iraq and a groundswell of Sunni support ? financed by the West ? in fighting the jihadi group.
The core of AQI¡¯s ideological and operational beliefs and practices has survived in Isis however. The group has inherited many of the hallmarks of AQI, and has been posting videos of beheadings of Assad-regime soldiers and Iraqi Shia and Kurds online for months.
Early assessments by many in the Western intelligence community concluded that Isis was primarily a group focused on a violent regional and sectarian struggle.
With Isis¡¯ declaration of a ¡°caliphate¡± in June, however, and with it a direct challenge to what remains of al-Qaeda, many European and American security officials have grown more worried about its international ambitions.
Since air strikes against the group by the US began, intelligence officials have grown more worried over Isis¡¯ attack planning against the West.
Of the estimated 3,000 Europeans who travelled to Syria to fight against Mr Assad¡¯s regime, the majority have become Isis members and represent a potential terrorist risk to Western states."

Stan, 68, of Mirfield, was left devastated in December when an upgrade of his phone line by Virgin Media wiped the precious greeting he had kept for 14 years.

The retired forklift truck driver took comfort in the voice of wife Ruby, who died of stomach cancer aged 63 in May, 2003.

Stan had been assured by the phone company that the recording would be saved after the upgrade and the firm was forced to apologise and offered to make donations to Stan¡¯s favourite charities after the blunder.

Red-faced bosses, though, didn¡¯t stop there and put a team of 10 engineers on the case until the recording was recovered.

Stan was overcome with emotion when he was played a recording of the voicemail and said: ¡°I felt pure elation and just couldn¡¯t believe it. I thought the recording was gone forever.

¡°I can¡¯t thank Virgin Media enough. Putting 10 people on the job must have cost them a fortune. I am staggered by that.¡±

Born in Kuwait, Emwazi comes from a """"well-to-do family"""" in West London and studied computer science at the University of Westminster.

The Post talked to multiple friends of Emwazi's who identified him as the jihadist militant responsible for the graphic beheadings of James Foley, Steven Sotloff, and others. Wearing a mask to obscure his identity, the executioner became known by his distinctive British accent, and he was dubbed """"Jihadi John"""" by the media.

Emwazi became radicalised after graduating from University, and he was known to authorities. He had been stopped and quizzed twice by security services, once in Tanzania and again in Britain.

Rogen's role in the highly anticipated Sony production was revealed on Thursday by film industry publication Variety. Rogen will star opposite Christian Bale, who will play the role of Steve Jobs.

The project has attracted top-level talent, as it will be directed by Danny Boyle, who won an Oscar for Best Director in 2008 for the film """"Slumdog Millionaire."""" Sorkin won his Academy Award in 2011 for """"The Social Network,"""" while Bale won Best Supporting Actor in 2011 for his performance in """"The Fighter.""""

Sorkin's script is expected to be loosely based on Walter Isaacson's official Jobs biography. The screenwriter has said the movie will consist of scenes that take place before the unveilings of three key products: the original Mac, NeXT and the iPod.

Wozniak left Apple in early 1987, which would put him at the company for just the launch of the original Mac. But Sorkin's films are not known to stick closely to historical facts, as seen in his depiction of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg in """"The Social Network.""""

The Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), an animal welfare charity, said the wrinkly-faced crossbreed was discovered last Friday at Ayr railway station. His suitcase was packed with a pillow, a toy, some food and a bowl.

The dog was microchipped, so the charity was able to find the dog¡¯s name, Kai. The group was also able to track Kai¡¯s previous owner whom the microchip was registered to.

His previous owners said they sold him on the classified ads website, Gumtree, in 2013. The were unable to provide the charity with the address of the person who bought Kai.

If found, the owner could be charged under Scotland¡¯s Animal Health and Welfare Act.

1001,"South Korea newspaper claims Kim fractured both ankles

Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader who has mysteriously been missing from the public eye for almost a month, sparking rumors covering every possibility from a stroke to a coup d¡¯etat, is merely recovering from ankle surgery, a South Korean newspaper has reported.

Kim had fractured both of his ankles and had surgery in Pyongyang in the middle of September to treat them, the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea¡¯s largest newspaper, reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source.

¡°I heard that Kim Jong Un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,¡± the source was quoted as saying, adding that he had the operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.

Such is the fascination with North Korea, the world¡¯s most impenetrable country, that rumors spread like wildfire. But they are almost always impossible to verify.

Nevertheless, it is true that Kim has become noticeably more rotund since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011. He was pictured limping in July during a ceremony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of his grandfather, former North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, causing speculation about his health.

But the gossip mill started up again last week when Kim, the third-generation leader of North Korea, missed a regular session of the Supreme People¡¯s Assembly in Pyongyang. He has not been seen in public since 3 September, when he attended a concert with his wife. It went into overdrive when the state-run Korean Central TV said the ¡°Great Successor,¡± as he is known, was in an ¡°indisposed condition.¡±

¡°Despite some discomfort, our Marshal continues to come out and lead the people,¡± said the narrator of a documentary called ¡°Improving the Lives of the People,¡± showing footage of Kim limping through the Taedonggang Tile Factory last month. It aired just before the session of the assembly, North Korea¡¯s quasi-parliament, was broadcast, the Daily NK Web site reported.

With Kim shown carting around heavy things, the narrator continued: ¡°His whole body is drenched in sweat, but he does not stop working hard, instead showing concern for the health of the other workers.¡±

Separately, the Rodong Sinmun, the mouthpiece of the Workers¡¯ Party, recently reported that Kim had ¡°labored on,¡± visiting various facilities braving the hot summer weather.

Outside commentators have guessed that Kim has gout, which runs in the family, or has been drinking and eating too much. Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence.

Weibo, China's version of Twitter, went crazy this week with reports that Jo Myong Rok, a North Korean vice marshal who died four years ago, had overthrown Kim in a coup and sent his lieutenants to South Korea for negotiations. Talk spread so quickly that the Global Times, one of China¡¯s official papers, ran a commentary Monday titled ¡°For those who make up rumors of coup in North Korea, is it so funny?""""

Rogen¡¯s appointment is said to be in no way a done deal, especially given that Bale has not yet signed on the dotted line. The Canadian star of This Is the End and Neighbours is best known for his work in comedic fare, and would be taking a rare step into the dramatic spotlight with the untitled biopic.

The reports began circulating late yesterday around Twitter:


So far there's nothing substantiating all the buzz. Cuban media outlets have denied any news conference is scheduled, and the hype also comes """"suspiciously close"""" to the actual death of Fidel Castro Odinga, the 41-year-old son of a Kenya opposition leader, as the Daily Mail reports.

1004,"(CNN) -- A woman held by Lebanese authorities is not the wife of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Iraq's Interior Ministry said Wednesday, injecting further confusion into an already murky situation.

The reported detention of a wife and child of al-Baghdadi -- the leader of a self-declared Islamic state spanning large areas of Iraq and Syria -- has spurred intrigue into who exactly the woman is and what she might know about the terrorist group's inner workings.

But the Iraqi ministry, citing a source in an intelligence cell under its authority, said the woman's identity didn't match up with either of the names it has for al-Baghdadi's two wives.

Authorities in Lebanon, where the woman was arrested, haven't officially commented on the matter. Neither has the CIA, amid suggestions that Western intelligence was involved in her capture.

Before the Iraqi announcement further muddied the waters, the details surrounding al-Dulaimi and her capture were already pretty fuzzy.

Here are some of the main areas of interest -- and contention.

She's his wife. Or his ex-wife. Or neither.

Regional sources close to the capture told CNN that they are certain that Lebanese forces arrested al-Baghdadi's wife.

But American sources in Washington gave a different view, suggesting the person detained was al-Baghdadi's ex-wife, not a current one.

Intelligence sources had told CNN that the woman's name is Saja al-Dulaimi. But the Iraqi ministry stated bluntly Tuesday, """"There is no wife named Saja al-Dulaimi.""""

It said al-Dulaimi is the sister of a man who is imprisoned in Iraq and has been sentenced to death for a series of bombings.

Iraqi intelligence identified al-Baghdadi's wives as Asma Fawzi Mohammed al-Dulaimi and Israa Rajab Mahal Al-Qaisi.

It doesn't help that Baghdadi's family life is cloaked in mystery.

A biography posted on jihadist websites last year gave little away, stating simply that he was """"married."""" CNN was told al-Baghdadi has two wives. The news agency Reuters, citing tribal sources in Iraq, said he has three.

And ISIS certainly isn't confirming anything. Some of its members took to social media Tuesday to deny that any wife of Baghdadi had been arrested.

She wielded power. But how much?

If the woman is indeed Al-Dulaimi, she is a """"powerful figure"""" within ISIS and is """"very active"""" in the organization, a regional source with knowledge of the operation told CNN.

She was reported to have previously been held by the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad. In March, al-Dulaimi was released from Syrian custody as part of a group of 150 women who were freed in return for a group of Syrian nuns, an intelligence source told CNN.

But her apparent attempt to cross into Lebanon with a child at a time when authorities there are tightening security around the border raises questions about the state of her relationship with al-Baghdadi.

""""Is he estranged from them? Has he fallen out with them? Were they escaping from him?"""" asked Sajjan M. Gohel, the international security director at the Asia Pacific Foundation.

Uncertainty also remains about how much influence al-Dulaimi would have had within ISIS, which is known for its oppressive treatment of women.

Analysts say women who join ISIS may find their role limited to that of housewife for jihadi men.

But in February, ISIS formed Al-Khansaa, a female battalion with about 60 members whose job is to inspect women who pass through checkpoints and to enforce the organization's strict morality code for women.

She could reveal vital intelligence. Or hardly anything.

The arrest of al-Dulaimi, if indeed it was her, was a coordinated operation involving intelligence agencies from Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, an intelligence source familiar with the arrest told CNN.

The source said the Iraqis had help from the U.S. intelligence community, an account corroborated by a second source in the region with knowledge of the operation. But in Washington, the CIA had no comment on the matter.

Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, expressed confidence that the United States would be able to """"gain some intelligence"""" from al-Dulaimi.

""""We may get insights into al-Baghdadi's movement, who he surrounds himself with, whether he was injured, and the degree of his injuries,"""" he said, referring to recent reports that al-Baghdadi was hurt in airstrikes.

Not everyone was convinced she would provide a treasure trove of insight into ISIS, though.

Expressing skepticism, a former senior U.S. military official told The New York Times that in the Iraq war, the Americans captured a wife of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader or al Qaeda in Iraq, ISIS' forerunner.

""""We got little out of her, and when we sent her back, Zarqawi killed her,"""" the unidentified official told the newspaper.

And since al-Dulaimi was reportedly seized more than a week ago, what intelligence she carried may already have passed its sell-by date.

""""In military conflicts, information flows are very immediate, and they become yesterday's news very quickly,"""" said Michael Stephens, a Middle East research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London.

She was with a son. Or a daughter.

The identity of the child with al-Dulaimi is still the subject of conflicting reports.

An intelligence source told CNN that the child was al-Dulaimi's 4-year-old son. Other news organizations, including Agence France-Presse and the Associated Press, also reported that it was a young boy.

But Reuters, which originally had reported the same thing, later revised its reporting to say that she was with a daughter. The New York Times also said it was a daughter rather than a son.

Deepening the intrigue, one regional source even told CNN that al-Baghdadi himself has been calling up asking for his son to be released.

The full picture of who exactly Lebanese authorities have in their custody is still to be revealed

1008,"A Catholic priest from Massachussetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart has revealed a shocking revelation that will change everything you once believed.

The 71-year-old cleric Father John Micheal O¡¯neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

Father John Micheal O¡¯neal was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival.

With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.

The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 minutes later and seems to have perfectly recovered.

The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.

He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like ¡°Being of Light¡±.

¡°Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting¡± states the Catholic priest. ¡°She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother¡¯s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn¡¯t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!

The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.

Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O¡¯neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the ¡°Holy Mother¡±.

¡°I wish to continue preaching¡± says the elderly cleric. ¡°I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman¡¦¡±

CNN aired the tape but cautioned that it could not independently verify whether it was authentic. It was allegedly filmed near the shooting scene in Ferguson, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis, on Aug. 9.

It was reportedly recorded by a Ferguson resident who could be heard talking with or about a woman while gunfire suddenly erupted in the background.

About six shots in rapid fire could be heard, followed by two seconds of quiet and four additional shots.

¡°That was what caught my attention initially,¡± said Lopa Blumenthal, a lawyer for the unnamed man who claims to have made the recording. ¡°It shows a point of contemplation.¡±

CNN said it could not corroborate the tape¡¯s authenticity, and has reached out to the FBI for confirmation.

Six months before he shot and killed unarmed teenager Michael Brown, police Officer Darren Wilson (pictured) earned a commendation for his ¡°extraordinary effort in the line of duty.¡± Wilson¡¯s father posted these photos to his Facebook page.

Michael Brown (left) was shot by Ferguson, Mo., Police Officer Darren Wilson (right).

Brown, 18, was unarmed when Officer Darren Wilson shot him after stopping the teen for jaywalking. Witnesses have said that after the initial confrontation with the cop, in which at least one round was fired, Brown was walking away with his hands up and was fired at again.

If the audio is verified by investigators, the pause could bolster the witness accounts.

A preliminary autopsy showed that the teenager was struck at least six times, with two bullets hitting his head.

1010,"Islamic State (ISIS) militants claim to have captured a supply bundle dropped by U.S. forces near the northern Syrian town of Kobani. Video posted to a YouTube channel associated with ISIS shows them rifling through packages containing dozens of grenades.

The supply package was apparently one of many intended for Kurdish fighters who have been battling ISIS militants for control of the strategically important town for weeks. The footage has not been independently verified.

According to Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby, the majority of supplies were safely delivered to Kurdish forces, which have been supported by a U.S.-led coalition as they defend the town. However, Kirby said that at least one supply package may have fallen into the hands of the Islamic State.

""""We are aware that one bundle was destroyed [via a video],"""" said Kirby. """"Analysts are working as fast as they can to validate it.""""

U.S. forces airdropped a total of 27 bundles containing weapons, ammunition and medical supplies early Monday. The supplies were provided by Kurdish authorities.

Kobani, located just yards from the Turkish border, has been the scene of an intense battle between Kurdish forces and ISIS militants, who attacked the area in late September.

Missing since Nov. 22, 2012, Foley appears to be forced to read an anti-American statement before he is beheaded in the gruesome five-minute clip.

An American freelance photojournalist missing since being abducted in Syria some 22 months ago was apparently beheaded by an Islamic State militant in a graphic video released Tuesday.

Titled ¡°A Message to America,¡± the gruesome clip shows a masked militant saw away at the neck of James Wright Foley, a 40-year-old New Hampshire native captured in Binesh, Syria on Thanksgiving Day 2012.

The family, on its """"Free James Foley"""" Facebook page, has yet to confirm his death.

""""Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers,"""" the statement reads.

Foley, dressed in orange and kneeling in a desert, reads what appears to be a coerced statement that alludes to recent American airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq.

¡°I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government. For what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality,¡± Foley reads as he kneels beside an armed militant, masked and dressed all in black. ¡°My message to my beloved parents: Save me some dignity, and don¡¯t accept some minor compensation for my death from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with their recent aerial campaign in Iraq. I call on my brother John, who is a member of the U.S. Air Force: Think about what you are doing. Think about the lives you destroy, including those of your own family ¡¦ I wish I could have the hope of freedom and seeing my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn¡¯t American.¡±

The militant, speaking English with what appears to a British accent, threatens America and President Obama, directly after Foley finishes speaking.

¡°So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the Muslims their rights of living in safety under the Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people,¡± the man says, gesturing with a knife he then uses to behead Foley.

The clip begins with a video of President Obama announcing Aug. 7. American intervention in Iraq against the militants.

¡°Today I authorized two operations in Iraq: targeted airstrikes to protect our American personnel, and a humanitarian effort to help save thousands of Iraqi civilians who are trapped on a mountain without food and water, and facing almost certain death,¡± Obama said in the clip.

The 40-year-old New Hampshire native has been missing since 2012.

James Foley was reporting in the Middle East when abducted.

Foley, 40, is a New Hampshire native. He was reporting in the Middle East when abducted.

Toward the end of the video, the terror group threatens to kill another hostage, Steven Joel Soltoff, a journalist who has contributed to TIME and has been missing since the middle of last year.

¡°The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,¡± the man says as he holds Soltoff by the neck.

The nearly five-minute clip has since been removed from YouTube. It¡¯s unclear where, exactly, the murder was filmed.

The White House, in a statement from National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden, confirmed they """"have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley.""""

""""The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity,"""" the statement reads. """"If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deppest condolences to his family and friends.""""

The blog just published a few renderings based on details from unnamed Apple employees. And if they're correct, this new MacBook looks awesome.

The report comes from 9to5Mac's Mark Gurman, who tends to be a reliable source on all things Apple. The details also match up with many of the rumors about MacBook upgrades in recent years. Chief among them is how Apple will ditch ports almost altogether to achieve a slimmer, sleeker profile. Sources say that prototypes for a new 12-inch MacBook Air are a quarter inch narrower than the current 11-inch model. They also have fewer ports than any other Apple computer: a headphone jack and a single USB Type-C port.

Another less dramatic detail is the slimmer keyboard. Apple's designers are channeling the old 12-inch PowerBook by pushing the keys all the way to the edge. They're also evidently narrowing the amount of space in between the keys to squeeze them together a little bit more. Meanwhile, the trackpad will no longer click in order to make the body thinner. It almost sounds like some sort of feature liquidation, all designed to make this machine as sleek as possible.

It looks pretty amazing, though! If that is what Apple actually does, of course. Click over the 9to5Mac for more on the new laptop design. [9to5Mac]

Research Medical Center says that patient came to its Brookside campus emergency department Saturday for treatment.

¡°Somebody went to an ER with a high fever and a history of having recently been to Nigeria,¡± said Jeff Hershberger, the spokesman for the KCMO Health Department.

He says because Ebola is so high-profile right now, they don¡¯t want to rule it out quite yet.

¡°There¡¯s a wide umbrella of things that it could be,¡± Hershberger said, ¡°We want to make sure, looking at that entire umbrella, that we are not ignoring something.¡±

The hospital does not believe the patient has Ebola, and says the patient is being treated for another illness. Hershberger says regardless, Ebola should not be a big concern.

¡°It¡¯s very unlikely they will even be exposed to it, let alone contract it,¡± Hershberger said, ¡°You cannot catch Ebola unless you touch the bodily fluids of somebody who has Ebola.¡±

1017,"WASHINGTON ? A man who scaled a White House fence this month and breached the mansion's front door apparently rushed past a Secret Service agent inside and was stopped only after reaching the building's East Room, a government official confirmed Monday.

New details of the incident involving Omar Gonzalez, who allegedly penetrated the mansion deeper than was previously known, were first reported Monday by The Washington Post.

The government official, who is not authorized to comment publicly about the incident, did not dispute the contents of the Post account.

Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan, citing an ongoing investigation, declined to comment on the report.

The disclosure comes as Secret Service Director Julia Pierson prepares to testify Tuesday before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.

Pierson is likely to address the Gonzalez incident, along with a shooting incident in 2011 which, according to a separate Post report, the Secret Service failed to recognize as an attack on the White House until days after discovering damage left by multiple rounds fired by a high-powered rifle.

In the more recent incident, Gonzalez reportedly overpowered a Secret Service officer and ran through the main floor.

An alarm box near the front entrance apparently had been muted.

Gonzalez, who was armed with a knife, allegedly made it into the East Room before he was taken down by an agent.

The fence-jumping incident and the delayed reporting of the White House shooting in 2011 represent the latest in a series of missteps by the elite protective service.

This year, three agents were sent home from the Netherlands before a presidential trip after one of the agents was discovered intoxicated in a hotel hallway.

1020,"YouTube prankster Josh Paler Lin decided to give a man named Thomas the money and follow him to see how he spends it. His first stop was a local liquor store but instead of buying alcohol he purchased food that he gave away to others in need.

A homeless man was given a chance, and he touched an awful lot of surprised people.

A viral online video from YouTube prankster Josh Paler Lin tells the story of a homeless man named Thomas and his desire to not let his circumstances keep him from being selfless - by using his newfound money to help not himself, but others.

Josh made the video, which has received more than 11 million hits by Wednesday morning, with the idea to give a random homeless person $100 and secretly follow him to see how he spends it.

He meets an elderly man with gray hair, a mustache and dark jacket named Thomas holding up a sign along a highway. He tells Josh he's just trying to get enough to buy something to eat and Josh shocks him with the $100.

""""Oh goodness. Oh no way,"""" he says as Josh pulls five $20 bills from his wallet. """"Oh brother, are you sure? I'm starting to tear up over here. That's like incredible.""""

Josh reassures him it's totally fine as they hug. Thomas says he never had something like this happen before in his life.

The next part of the video seemed to be expected by many viewers but Thomas surprised them all.

He packed up his stuff and began walking down the road to a liquor store. The video records him exit the store with several bags, but he didn't buy alcohol.

He purchased food that he then delivered to other needy people in a nearby park.

Josh appears to tell Thomas what was going on.

""""I feel like I owe you an apology,"""" Josh said as he reaches to grab Thomas' hand. """"You went to a liquor store earlier ?""""

""""You thought I was going to get all smacked up drunk, huh?"""" Thomas interrupts. """"But there's things money can't buy and I get a happiness out of what I'm doing.""""

Ironically during Josh's confession a man sitting at a picnic table behind them takes a swig from a bottle wrapped in a plastic bag.

But Josh wanted to contribute to Thomas's good deeds. He reached into his wallet again and gave him another $100.

""""You just touched my heart,"""" he told his new friend.

Thomas was stunned again.

""""I don't know what to say. Usually I'm pretty talkative,"""" he replied.

Thomas explained that he recently quit his job and was caring for his ailing stepfather who ultimately died of cancer. His mom died two weeks later from kidney failure and suddenly their building was sold leaving Thomas without a place to live.

""""There's a lot of people that are just victims of circumstance. There's a lot of good people that are homeless,"""" he said. """"You're doing good ¡¦ you'll bump into good people. That's all there is to it. You're on a different path somehow in life. I can't explain it.""""

But Josh is trying to change his path.

He established a fund-raising campaign to help Thomas get a new home and a job.

The fund had a goal of $10,000 but it surpassed $55,000 through Wednesday morning.

""""People think I changed his life,"""" Josh told TODAY. """"For me, it's completely the opposite. I feel that he changed my life.""""

It happened in Ganganagar in the north-western state of Rajasthan, in graphic scenes captured on video.

According to local authorities, the extreme action was a response to high-profile incidences of sexual attacks in India.

World-wide condemnation greeted the gang-rape of a student on a bus two years ago, which shook the image of the country.

Alleged attacker Suresh Kumar, 40, molested a teenager in a street, but her screams for help alerted a crowd which came to her aid.

Kumar was dragged into a nearby butcher's shop and beaten heavily with sticks for nearly an hour, according to reports. Vigilantes then hacked at his genitals with a meat cleaver, before throwing them into the street.

The incident left Kumar in a critical condition.

A reported witness said the action was intended to send out a message that sexual assault was not tolerated.

Aamir Dhawan, 30, said: """"We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it's time it stopped.

1024,"A 10-year-old member of the ISIS terror group has been reportedly killed while fighting in the Middle East. Going by the name Abu Obadya al-Abassi, ISIS posted a video on YouTube Wednesday announcing his death.

""""It should be noted that there is no independent confirmation regarding the authenticity of the clip which was posted on YouTube showing the boy dressed in military fatigues and carrying weapons,"""" the Post reported.

Those who've watched the clip have expressed """"disgust over the use of children in warfare,"""" it continued.

ISIS was formed last year from the group al-Qaida in Iraq and is led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. They have garnered international attention for their atrocities in Northern Iraq and civil war torn Syria.

Known as the """"Cub of Baghdadi,"""" the 10-year-old al-Abassi was a native of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

For its part, Saudi Arabia's top religious official has denounced ISIS, calling them in recent statements enemies of Islam and civilization.

Saudi Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Aziz al-Sheikh issued the statement in August via the Saudi Press Agency.

""""Extremist and militant ideas and terrorism which spread decay on earth, destroying human civilization,"""" said al-Sheikh, """"are not in any way part of Islam, but are enemy number one of Islam, and Muslims are their first victims.""""

It is believed, though unconfirmed, that both al-Abassi and his father were killed in an airstrike by the United States as fighting continues.

1025,"Apple is reportedly limiting what Apple Watch apps are capable of doing, ruling out certain features in order to ensure battery life is not too heavily drained in the initial model, which could tarnish the high-profile launch.

According to Business Insider, developers working on applications for the new Apple wearable have cautioned that consumers should temper their expectations of what the initial Apple Watch is capable of.

The caution harkens back to the initial iPhone launch, when the App Store did not exist, and only the apps pre-loaded by Apple could be used. While the smartphone ecosystem has dramatically changed since then, and Apple¡¯s App Store has proved a template for a new industry, the Apple Watch looks as though it may mirror this model until capabilities improve.

The primary issue is battery life, and Apple¡¯s continued attempts to increase the time between recharges. Earlier reports suggested that the device would have only four hours of active battery life, and many of the sensor features initially touted to be included have been cut due to inconsistency.

Those sensors that do remain are the source of many of the battery issues, according to Sumit Mehra, CTO of Y Media Labs, an app studio which has been developing content for the Apple Watch.

¡°Sensors take up a lot of battery, and they don¡¯t want every app out there on the Apple Watch using these sensors because all of a sudden this watch will only give you four hours of battery life, and then it¡¯s not a watch anymore if I have to charge my wrist every four hours,¡± said Mehra in a statement to Business Insider.

Apple has not yet released its WatchKit SDK for developing standalone apps for the Apple Watch, with developers at the moment limited to creating extensions to iPhone apps that will function on the watch. This helps save battery for the wearable, and means apps can run on the iPhone¡¯s superior processor, but also limits Apple Watch apps to notifications, app extensions and presenting summaries of information ? essentially limited versions of what the iPhone can already do.

With the expected launch of the Apple Watch less than a week away, and Apple predicting huge numbers of sales for its first ever wearable, consumers might be wise to rethink what the device is going to be capable of, at least for the time being."

1027,"Nigerian military and intelligence officials raised doubts on Sunday about the validity of a ceasefire with Boko Haram, with reports of fresh attacks and fighting in the country's northeast.

The chief of defence staff and a senior presidential aide announced on Friday that agreement had been reached to end hostilities and secure the possible release of more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls.

Air Marshal Alex Badeh said he had instructed all armed forces' chiefs to ensure the """"immediate compliance"""" with the development.

But a senior army officer in the violence-wracked northeast, who asked to remain anonymous, said: """"Honestly, we are yet to receive any operational order on the ceasefire.

""""As such, we are battle-ready and would confront the terrorists if we see them.""""

A senior intelligence official in the region also indicated to AFP that he had not received word about the purported ceasefire.

On Sunday evening, troops from the 7th Division of the Nigerian Army fought dozens of suspected members of Boko Haram in the town of Damboa in Borno state, witnesses and security sources said.

Earlier, a group of insurgents attacked the Borno town of Sabon Gida, said one military officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.

""""The fight was tough and it seems the insurgents wanted to destroy everything in Sabon Gida. They came around 5:00pm and by 6:00pm, the fight was over,"""" added local trader Bilyaminu Aliyu.

Boko Haram took over Damboa, which is about 50 miles southwest of the Borno state capital Maiduguri, in July, destroying much of the town and forcing thousands to flee.

The group's leader Abubakar Shekau claimed that they left voluntarily but the military said they recaptured it in early August. Residents have since begun returning.

Elsewhere, locals said that dozens of suspected Boko Haram gunmen had stormed the town of Abadam, north of Maiduguri near Lake Chad, on Thursday, before the supposed ceasefire.

A number of residents said at least 30 people were killed on Thursday and Friday ? after the purported deal ? while hundreds of others were forced to flee across the border into neighbouring Niger.

""""We all heard of the ceasefire over the radio but it seems the insurgents are not perturbed at all,"""" another resident, Mallam Babagana, said on Sunday.

""""To me, they (the militants) don't even care about it because they increased their attacks from Friday, the very day the ceasefire was announced. By Saturday, they hoisted their flags.""""

Meanwhile, Enoch Mark, whose daughter and niece are among the 219 schoolgirls who have been held by Boko Haram since mid-April, said there had been another attack in neighbouring Adamawa state.

He said the attack, in the village of Wagga on Saturday, saw some 40 women abducted ? an established Boko Haram tactic in its bloody five-year insurgency.

On Friday, eight people were also killed on a road in the Borno state village of Shaffa near where a prominent Muslim leader, the Emir of Gwoza, was ambushed and killed by Boko Haram fighters in May.

Mr Babagana said local hunters on their way to recover the bodies of the eight fought battles with militants on Saturday in Azul, also in the Hawul local government area.

""""The unrelenting terrorists waylaid our members at around 9:00am and serious fighting ensued,"""" said Mr Babagana, who heads a local vigilante group.

""""We lost four of our members and we killed three terrorists.""""

Independent corroboration of attacks in the remote northeast are almost impossible, with communications devastated by the violence and access fraught with danger.

The police and the military have largely stopped communicating on attacks.

But while Mr Ferrari's fish might set a new record for the biggest ever caught on a line, it is not the heaviest ever hooked - that award goes to catfish which weighed 22st and was 9ft long, and was caught in the Po Delta, reports The Mirror.

In December schoolboy Sam Lee, 14, caught an 8ft 14 stone catfish while on a fishing holiday in Spain with his father Peter.

The giant catfish immediately bolted 100 metres downstream, but Sam, from Chester, hung on and after a 35 minute battle finally landed the 2.5 metre-long fish.

In October a Cornish pensioner caught an 8ft-long, 15 stonepart-albino catfish, thought to be the biggest of its kind ever caught.

The aptly named Tom Herron, 68, from Launceston, battled the cream-coloured monster fish in the River Segre, Mequinenza, Spain, for 40 minutes before finally hauling it in.

The wels catfish is scaleless and lives in fresh and brackish water.

It is recognisable by its broad, flat head and wide mouth.

The wels catfish can live for thirty years and live off annelid worms, gastropods, insects, crustaceans and fish including other catfish; the larger ones also eat frogs, mice, rats, and even ducks.

Recently, wels catfish have been spotted in non-native habitats lunging out of the water to grab pigeons on land."

Taylor Lianne Chandler, who also described her ¡®amazing intimacy¡¯ with the athlete, admitted on Facebook that her birth name was David Roy Fitch.

Olympic medallist Michael Phelps is currently in rehab at the moment due to a six-month ban from swimming due to driving under the influence.

The 41-year-old, who is technically ¡®intersex¡¯, was born with both male genitalia and a uterus but had neither ovaries nor testicles.

She was technically listed as a boy on her birth certificate at first but was eventually ¡®medically diagnosed¡¯ as intersex rather than being male or female in her early teens.

She underwent corrective surgery in her early twenties to remove her penis as well as taking testosterone blockers and changing her name.

However, she reveals that she never told the 29-year-old athlete as it ¡®never came up¡¯. She suspects he may now leave her after her public admission.

She wrote in the Facebook post: ¡®I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man.¡¯

Brief Analysis
The claims are nonsense. No such incident has occurred in Texas or anywhere else in the US. The story comes from a dubious 'news' site called Daily Buzz Live that publishes a combination of sensationalized but factual news items and outright fiction disguised as news. The 'Ebola Turkey' story is an example of the latter.

Texas Turkey Farm Contaminated With Ebola, Over 250,000 Holiday Turkeys Infected

A Texas turkey farm employee is now under quarantine after he tested positive for the Ebola virus. Texas Prime Turkey Farm, the largest supplier of turkeys in the United States, has been ordered by the CDC to quarantine over 250,000 holiday turkeys. The CDC has confirmed 3,000 turkeys have tested positive for the virus since Friday¡¯s incident.

Detailed Analysis

 
Story Claims Texas Turkeys Contaminated With Ebola
According to a story that is flapping vigorously around the interwebs, thousands of holiday turkeys at the Texas Prime Turkey Farm have been contaminated with Ebola. 

The story claims that an Ebola infected worker on the farm contaminated the turkeys. Supposedly, the CDC has confirmed that 3000 of the turkeys have already been tested positive for the virus and that the farm has been ordered to burn all 250,000 turkeys.

The story features a photograph depicting a huge farm shed littered with the bodies of deceased turkeys.

Story Is False - No Such Incident Has Occurred
Thankfully, however, the claims in the story are nonsense.  No such incident has occurred, in Texas or anywhere else.  

The report comes from a trashy 'news' site called Daily Buzz Live.  While the site does include some sensationalized reports on real incidents, it also features stories that are entirely fiction.  The site has the following disclaimer on its Contact page:

1036,"British Intelligence officials have zeroed in on a suspect in the on-camera ISIS murder of American journalist Jim Foley, and he is widely believed to be a slim, light-skinned rapper from London. 

Though the MI5 and MI6 agencies are not releasing the man's name, reports say Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary ? also known as ¡°Lyricist Jinn¡± or ¡°L Jinny¡± ? is the main suspect. According to USA Today, he was identified via voice comparisons, and Abdel Bary's music career left them plenty of samples to consider. USA Today reports that U.S. intelligence has not yet been able to confirm the results.

Abdel Bary's father, Adel Abdel Bari, is believed to have been an associate of Osama bin Laden's and was allegedly involved in the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings. He was extradited to the U.S. in 2012.

The younger Bary's music seems to chart his path to radicalization:

In early songs put online in 2012, Bary makes apparent reference to drug use, violence and life on a council estate and talks about the threat of his family being deported to Egypt.

 ¡°It¡¯s hard to progress in the future with a damaged past but still I try to count my blessings and I thank Allah,¡± he rapped in 2012.

¡°I¡¯m trying to change my ways but there¡¯s blood on my hands and I can¡¯t change my ways until there's funds in the bank.

¡°I can¡¯t differentiate the angels from the demons, my heart¡¯s disintegrating. I ain't got normal feelings.

¡°Even my life¡¯s blessed, still I will not find rest.¡±

In later songs, apparent references to cannabis (¡°roll up and watch the leaves ignite¡±) stop and are replaced with tirades against people who choose to spend their money clubbing, drinking and on drugs rather than feeding their families.

1046,"The Weather Channel¡¯s Mike Seidel has taken a lot of ribbing about what he was doing live on network TV this weekend.  But he didn¡¯t do what online news sites and YouTubers suggest he did.



Seidel was reporting from Sugar Mountain, North Carolina Saturday where an early season storm dropped 10 inches of snow. NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt introduced Seidel while the meteorologist¡¯s back was turned to the camera. Seidel was hunched over fiddling with something. To an awful lot of people who saw Holt dump out of the live shot, it appeared Seidel was zipping up his pants, having answered nature¡¯s call.


The NY Daily news headline taunted, ¡°NBC meteorologist Mike Seidel appears to relieve himself during broadcast.¡±

But that is not what happened at all, said Shirley Powell, the Weather Channel¡¯s spokesperson. Seidel, she said, was using his cell phone as an IFB (that is short for interruptible feedback) which is how reporters in the field get their cues from the control room. The phone lost its signal just as the anchor was introducing the live shot. Powell told Poynter.org that Seidel yanked off his gloves, turned from the howling wind and was dialing the IFB when Holt tossed to him. Since Seidel didn¡¯t have a phone signal, he didn¡¯t know he was on the air. While he frantically dialed the phone, Seidel tucked his heavy gloves between his knees to keep them from blowing away. When he finished dialing, he yanked his gloves back on and turned to the camera but Holt was already calling off the shot and moving on. Seidel was left hanging in the winter wind.

¡°I¡¯m glad for you to tell what really happened,¡± Powell told me.

The crew was using a LiveU mobile live system, which is a backpack sized phone based transmitter andSeidel would not have had a live truck engineer who might have alerted the control room of the communication problem. We still don¡¯t know why the producer in the control booth took the shot live on the air with Seidel turned away.

On his Weather Channel bio page, Seidel is asked, ¡°What is your most embarrassing moment on the air?¡±  He answers ¡°Do you want a list?¡±  Whatever was on that list before now just took a back seat. And sadly for Seidel, the video will live forever online."
1047,"The North Korean leader already has a restaurant in Holland and is hoping to branch out and build diplomatic ties with European cities

Kim Jong-un could try and open a restaurant in Scotland serving delicacies such as dog meat soup, North Korea experts claim.

This comes after the controversial leader brought his chain, The 'Pyongyang' restaurants, over to Europe by launching one in Holland.

Now North Korea watchers believe Scotland may be the next prime location, largely thanks to the popularity of whisky among the communist ruling elite.

Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch, said Jong-un is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries with left-wing leanings.

He added: """"It would not surprise me at all if they opted to open a restaurant in Scotland.

""""The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean elite's thoughts.

Getty   Tasty: Kim Jong-Un is a fan of delicacies such as dog meat soup

""""Despite voting No' they'd consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England.

""""Plus, North Koreans love whisky. Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.""""

The chain has begun springing up across China and Asia, with proceeds funnelled back to North Korea to help prop up the secretive regime.

They are run in partnership with Office 39, a secretive branch of the North Korean government, which uses them as a legal way of raising overseas cash.

Mr Madden, a frequent visitor to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, said: """"They are one of the few ways to experience North Korean culture without having to go there.

""""They are done like a franchise with the state renting the brand out to other Koreans to run.

""""But they tailor the menus to suit. Customers in Western Europe won't get a plateful of dog!""""

Reuters   Hungry dictator: Kim Jong Un looking at fast food

Fellow expert Jenny Town, of the US-Korea Institute, said she too believed Pyongyang had warmed to Scotland in recent months.

She said: """"North Korea is going to support any country struggling for independence and legitimacy, as North Korea itself still continues to seek validation and recognition of its own legitimacy as a sovereign nation.""""

The state-run food outlets - which began springing up about 10 years ago - channel up to 30% of takings back to Pyongyang. But some critics fear the cash ends up in Jong-un's own pockets to fund his lifestyle.

As well as a love for whisky, portly leader Jong-un is reportedly hooked on Swiss cheese.

It's claimed he imports vast quantities at huge expense - despite millions of his countrymen being malnourished.

The FBI recently accused North Korea of being behind cyber attacks on the US. The regime is thought to be incensed at a film, The Interview, which centres around the fictional assassination of Kim Jong-un.

1048,"Amazon is reportedly planning to launch an ad-supported media streaming service for music and videos, the New York Post reports.

The service would exist in addition to its $99 Prime membership subscription, which includes free, two-day shipping on thousands of items alongside music, TV, and movie streaming options.

The Wall Street Journal reported similar plans in March, pegging the service as being free. At the time, Amazon denied that it had plans to offer a free streaming-media service.

The Post, however, doesn't say that the service would be free, and instead suggests that the new service would likely compete with Netflix and Hulu, while under-cutting them on price (Netflix costs and Hulu Plus cost $7.99 a month).

Amazon's Sally Fouts sent the following via email: """"We currently offer the first episode of some television shows free with ads through our First Episode Free feature on Amazon Instant Video, and there are display ads on some short videos such as movie and game trailers. We¡¯re often experimenting with new offers and experiences for customers, but we have not announced any plans to offer an ad-supported video streaming service.""""

At its core, the idea of this service makes sense.

Amazon could use this new, cheaper streaming service as a way to ease people into its ecosystem so they'll be more likely to eventually make the jump to Prime, while also giving it a way to entice potential customers who don't care about Prime's free shipping but want a Netflix alternative.

1049,"(CNN) -- Paul Revere hasn't stirred up this much anticipation in Boston since his midnight ride from Charlestown to Lexington.

More than two centuries later, a recently unearthed time capsule he buried with fellow revolutionary Samuel Adams -- the man whom Revere was riding to see that night to warn that the British were coming -- has got his former city, state and most of the Internet abuzz.

The artifact was unearthed Thursday thanks to a water leak near its resting place inside a cornerstone at the Massachusetts State House in Boston.

When workers investigating the leak stumbled upon it, Secretary of State William Galvin, who heads the state historical commission, called Pamela Hatchfield, the head of object conservation at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts.

""""There was a big discussion about whether or not it should be removed,"""" Hatchfield told Brooke Baldwin on """"CNN Newsroom"""" on Friday. """"(But) because there was water infiltration in that area of the building, it was decided that we'd try to see if we could find it, investigate and see whether the box was still intact.""""

Hatchfield spent seven hours Thursday delicately and painstakingly chipping away at the stone to extricate it.

""""The contents are of concern, but the plaster that held the box in place is in good condition,"""" Galvin said.

According to Galvin, the box-shaped capsule was placed by the Revolutionary-era duo in 1795, a year when Adams was governor and when construction began on the State House and its iconic dome, which would eventually be overlaid with copper by Revere.

Both he and Hatchfield said that based on historical records, the box is believed to contain coins, a plate and a Revere-inscribed plaque -- but no one knows for sure.

""""It may contain other stuff, too,"""" said Galvin. """"We don't know that yet.""""

But we might soon: Galvin, whose office is inside the State House, said the capsule's contents are expected to be revealed sometime next week.

For now, it's getting some TLC and a thorough exam -- including X-rays over the weekend -- by the museum's staff.

This is not the first time this capsule was unearthed. In 1855 it was dug up during emergency repairs to the State House and put back in place, something that has Hatchfield """"a little worried.""""

""""We're a little worried because in 1855, they cleaned the contents with acid,"""" she said. """"So we're a little concerned that things maybe deteriorated inside.""""

Galvin sounded more optimistic.

""""There were some coins that were tossed in the 1855 ceremony in the mix of the mortar. They are in good condition, so we are optimistic that the box itself has withstood the test of time and that it will therefore be holding the contents securely,"""" he said.

Galvin told CNN affiliate WBZ the capsule will probably be returned to the State House, and that he's mulling both a new container for the capsule and new items from the current era.

The Independent has a good explainer on why the video below is fake. 

But if it had been real, the symbolism would have been spot on. During his speech, Putin emphasized a strong belief in promoting peace, even as Russia's policies have only provoked and perpetuated violence in Ukraine and Crimea, which he invaded. Despite his words, Russia announced on Monday that it will hold military exercises on its border with Ukraine in a show of strength, according to Reuters.

1053,"Stan Beaton had kept a voicemail from his late wife for 14 years when an upgrade to his phone line caused the recording to be deleted.

Work by Virgin Media caused the message, which was left by Beaton¡¯s wife, Ruby, two years before her death in 2003, to be erased last month, the BBC reported.

The clip was recorded by Ruby to serve as the message people would hear when they called Beaton¡¯s phone.

The 68-year-old told BBC Radio Leeds: ¡°I¡¯ve always resisted changing companies because whenever I mentioned that my wife¡¯s voice was our voicemail message and would it be retained and each company said no, so that¡¯s why I never changed.

¡°Sadly it disappeared. I was absolutely devastated by it, but also extremely angry.

¡°In the early days [I listened to it] quite often. Basically, it came to the point when if I felt low then I would listen to it.

¡°In December I learned that it had disappeared. I just could not tell people how it affected me at that time. It really did devastate me.¡±

Then, having heard Beaton¡¯s story, a team of 11 engineers decided to try to recover the deleted audio recording.

Rob Evans, executive director of engineering at Virgin Media, told the BBC the task was like searching for a needle in a haystack.

¡°The chances of its recovery were slim,¡± he admitted.

But after three days of searching, the team found the message on Friday.

According to 71-year-old cleric Father John Micheal O'neal claims that God is a warm and comforting motherly figure, whom he met in the heaven.

Father John Micheal O'neal was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival.

1056,"Experts have raised doubts about whether a loud boom and a gaping crater found in Nicaragua's crowded capital Managua this weekend were caused by a meteorite, as the government has said.

The impact near the international airport did not cause any known injuries, but it did leave a crater measuring 12 metres across and was felt throughout the capital.

The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Monday said that while a meteorite could not be ruled out, the lack so far of any eyewitness accounts of a fireball lighting up the nighttime sky outside Managua on Saturday suggests something else was likely behind the event.

Bill Cooke, head of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office, estimated that the crater would have been created by a blast of roughly an energy equivalent of 1 ton of TNT.

NASA said in a statement that a meteor capable of that would have created a ball of flame visible over a wide area. About 1.5 million people live in the Nicaraguan capital.

""""For something to produce a hole in the ground that big, it would have generated a very bright fireball. And nothing was reported ... despite the population,"""" Cooke said. """"So I'm very sceptical.""""

Nicaraguan authorities believe it was a piece of the small asteroid dubbed """"2014 RC,"""" which passed very close to Earth and was estimated by astronomers to be about 20 meters big, or the size of a house.

'Fascinating event'

Government officials and experts visited the impact site on Sunday.

One of them, William Martinez, said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil.

""""You can see mirror-like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power-scraped the walls,"""" Martinez said.

Government spokeswoman, First Lady Rosario Murillo, said Nicaraguan authorities would be in contact with the US Geological Service to try to get more information about """"this fascinating event"""" in the Central American nation, one of Latin America's poorest countries.

People who live near the crater told local media they heard a blast they took for an explosion, and that liquid, sand and dust were blown through the air, which smelled like something had burned.

There were no reported injuries because the impact was in a wooded spot, and flights at the airport were not affected."
1057,"Claim: A vacationing man discovered that increasing pain he was experiencing was due to a tropical spider's living under his skin.

PROBABLY FALSE

Example: [Collected via Twitter, October 2014]

Spider burrowed into WA man's abdomen and lived there for three days while he was on holiday in Bali. Ohhhh My Gawwd!

Origins: On 15 October 2014, social media lit up with a seemingly implausible tale. An Australian man named Dylan Thomas quickly became the subject of international buzz (via Facebook) after he asserted that during his vacation trip to Bali, a spider burrowed under his skin and had to be surgically removed. Thomas' frightening spider story was picked up by news outlets in Australia, then Europe, and eventually in the U.S. Images sourced from Thomas' Facebook circulated as well via news outlets on Twitter and Facebook:

Spider burrows through man's appendix scar and crawls under his skin http://t.co/pbNc9kGcjA pic.twitter.com/DVVTvY5NtC? Daily Mail Online (@MailOnline) October 16, 2014

Although Thomas' tale spread quite widely, nearly all the initial reports of it stemmed from the same source, an article published by the Australian news site NT News:

Bunbury local Dylan Thomas' first trip to Bali was complete with a visit to the Bali International Medical Centre to have a tropical spider pulled out of his stomach.

21-year-old Dylan awoke after a quiet night in his four and a half star hotel room to find a bizarre red trail two inches from his naval [sic] and heading upwards.

""""It was as if someone had scratched me with the tip of a knife,"""" he said.

Later that evening, the trail had moved two or three inches higher.

When a concerned Dylan fronted up to the doctors, they told him it was a small insect bite, and gave him some antihistamine cream to rub on the red line.

Later that morning he awoke to blisters.

?That's when it became painful, it was a searing burn,? he said.

He finally saw a dermatologist, who told him that it was something out of the ordinary.

Doctors extracted a tropical spider that had burrowed itself into the scar from Dylan's recent appendix removal.

The doctors put the spider in a container and took it away for testing.

Dylan will be informed next week as to what kind of spider made home in his body for three days.

Moreover, all the information contained in that article came from Thomas himself, thus unleashing on the Internet that bane of fact-checkers: the single-source, self-reported, uncorroborated implausible story. And not only was that story reminiscent of several other familiar arachnid-based urban legends that have circulated for more than a century, such as those about spiders living or laying eggs under human skin, but the reporting agency (Australian Nothern Territory's NT News) is one akin to America's National Enquirer or Weekly World News : the online version of a tabloid that publishes silly, sensationalized articles such as """"Obama Gets Croc Insurance,"""" """"Frog Gets Struck Down by Lightning,"""" and """"Best Man Left Bleeding After Being Hit in Eye by Flying Dildo."""" (The story has since been published by more staid news sources as well.)

We've found no documented cases of spiders living and burrowing under human skin, or even any information suggesting that such an occurrence is possible. Christopher Buddle, an associate professor at McGill University's Department of Natural Resource Sciences, addressed Thomas' claim in an e-mail, saying that the story didn't wash with what we know about spider behavior:

I think this is extremely suspect, unusual, and likely not possible. Simply put: it is not plausible and I can think of no valid reason why a spider might 'crawl beneath skin through a scar'. The claim that it was 'feeding and moving up through the scar tissue' defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders. I am also sceptical because the 'evidence' (the spider itself) is not presented.

As noted, no corroborating information about this alleged medical case has been offered: no pictures of the skin-invading spider have been presented, no doctors involved in treating the patient have been quoted, and no witnesses to the spider removal other than Dylan Thomas himself have been referenced.

Perhaps there's a germ of truth to this story that has been distorted through misdiagnosis or misunderstanding, but in the absence of any other evidence we remain extremely skeptical about the tale as presented.

1063,"Apple is planning to release its slimmest MacBook yet, boasting a single USB port and 12-inch display, according to a new report.

Rumours site 9to5Mac created artist renditions of the revamped model based on information from sources within the company, which it says in the first major shakeup of the Mac line since the introduction of the Retina MacBook Pro in 2012.

The 12-inch model would slot neatly into the current range, which is comprised of an 11-inch and 13-inch model. The new version is slimmer than both predecessors, but sports the same 'tapered' design from top to bottom.

But such a slimline frame comes at a price; as Apple appears to have done away with standard USB ports and SD card slot. A single USB Type-C port remains, and the gaps between keyboard keys narrowed in order to minimise space.

Four speaker grills positioned between the screen and keyboard double up as ventilation, as the model has no fan. The trackpad is taller than that of the 11-inch model, and the keyboard has been designed to sit edge-to-edge across the width of the laptop, with a notably slimmer margin.

UK pricing and the release date of the potential new model remain unknown.

The first MacBook Air was introduced by former chief executive Steve Jobs at the 2008 Macworld Conference and Expo, where he claimed the company had built the world's thinnest notebook. The MacBook Air replacing the white MacBook as the standard entry model after its discontinuation in 2011.

The news comes as reports circulate that Apple is preparing for the Apple Watch to go on sale by the end of March.

1064,"DUBAI:  A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric has whipped up controversy by issuing a religious ruling forbidding the building of snowmen, describing them as anti-Islamic.

Asked on a religious website if it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for their children after a snowstorm in the country's north, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid replied, """"It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.""""

Quoting from Muslim scholars, Sheikh Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, an action considered sinful under the kingdom's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.

""""God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,"""" he wrote in his ruling.

That provoked swift responses from Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names. """"They are afraid for their faith of everything ... sick minds,"""" one Twitter user wrote.

A third said the country was plagued by two types of people: """"A people looking for a fatwa (religious ruling) for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa,"""" the user wrote.

Sheikh Munajjid had some supporters, however. """"It (building snowmen) is imitating the infidels, it promotes lustiness and eroticism,"""" one wrote.

""""May God preserve the scholars, for they enjoy sharp vision and recognise matters that even Satan does not think about,"""" said another.

1065,"According to a new survey conducted by analysts at UBS, interest in the smartwatch market is continuing to grow ahead of the Apple Watch launch early next year. Of the 4,000 respondents asked to partake in the survey across four different countries, about 10 percent cited that they are """"very likely"""" to buy a smartwatch in the next year. Based on projections of Apple's iPhone sales and the current installed base of iPhones compatible with the Apple Watch, the analysts predict Apple will sell 24 million Apple Watches within the first nine months.Figure 10 indicates that 10% of respondents (401 out of 4,000) are very likely and 17% (682 out of 4,000) somewhat likely to buy a smartwatch in the next 12 months. That is a three-fold increase vis-?-vis the 386 respondents claiming to already own a smartwatch and a four-fold increase if we assume that around one-third of the currently owned smartwatches are actually fitness bands.
Based on an estimate of 240 million iPhones compatible with Apple Watch being in customers' hands by the end of 2015, UBS suggests this could translate to 24 million Apple Watches sold in the first 9-12 months of availability, depending on supplies.

In a smaller survey of customers who registered as very likely to purchase a smart watch, the Apple Watch placed second to the Samsung Gear in buying intentions, although UBS expects those positions to reverse once the Apple Watch becomes available.

The analysts also expect the new Apple wearable to redefine the category much like previous products from the company have done for their respective technological categories. Despite first-version limitations in daily charging and iPhone tethering, UBS sees significant potential for the Apple Watch and predicts it will become the spiritual successor to the iPhone in the long-term.Cellular and battery technology is not yet sufficiently miniaturized to fit in the Watch and allow independent functioning. We would think the ability to do so is maybe five years away. In fact, the screen size differential may mean that the Watch and the iPhone will prove complements rather than substitutes. Arguably that is the way the iPad and Mac might be playing out, different products for different jobs.

Given that about two-thirds of Apple's profit is generated by the iPhone, the company has to be concerned about the longer-term threat of replacement technology, whether it be a leap in handset technology or loss of key functions to wearables. With a sophisticated user interface and third-party apps coming on, Apple may be readying for the time when the Apple Watch encroaches on the smartphone market. The Apple Watch is set to launch in """"early 2015"""", reportedly in the """"spring"""" according to an internal video from retail chief Angela Ahrendts.

1066,"We still don¡¯t know the exact date the Apple Watch will ship, but a new rumor claims you won¡¯t be able to pick one up at BestBuy, Walmart, or other non-Apple Stores at launch.

Apple plans to make its timepiece an Apple Store exclusive, according to German distribution sources who claim resellers will be shut out so Cupertino can suck up as much Apple Watch profits in the first year as possible.

We can¡¯t verify the sources, so the rumor should be taken with some healthy skepticism, however, we¡¯ve already heard rumblings that Apple is redesigning Apple Stores just for the Apple Watch launch. Leaning on Apple Store to provide the best possible sales experience during the introductory year would make sense.

The Online Apple Store will also sell the wearable. Vaults will supposedly be added to Apple Stores to keep the pricey gold Apple Watches secure. Stores will also have glass viewing cases for the expensive models. Customers will be able to ask specialists to try the different models on, while smaller tables are also supposedly planned so that the Apple Watch Sport and others are better staged.

Apple most likely wants to keep the selling experience on its terms until people are more familiar with what an Apple Watch is. The iPhone was exclusively available at Apple Stores and carriers before distribution deals were later struck with Best Buy, Walmart, Target and others.

Tim Cook revealed the Apple Watch will ship in April. The exact pricing for Apple Watch an Edition models, as well as launch details, are expected to be announced at an event in March."

1069,"There were conflicting reports about the outcome of the operation

A British-born photojournalist has reportedly been killed by al-Qaeda militants in Yemen during a failed rescue attempt by US special forces.

Luke Somers, 33, had been held hostage since being kidnapped in the capital, Sana¡¯a, in September 2013 as he left a supermarket.

There were conflicting reports on Saturday morning about the outcome of a joint US-Yemeni operation to free him. Some said an unnamed American hostage had been rescued while others said Mr Somers was dead.

His captors had taunted his family after a previous attempt by American and Yemeni forces to free him, saying on Thursday they would execute him within three days if the US did not meet their demands.

Al-Qaeda released a video statement from Mr Somers, where he said: ¡°I¡¯m looking for any help that can get me out of this situation. I¡¯m certain that my life is in danger.""""

Lucy Somers, his sister, told the Associated Press today that FBI agents informed her he was killed in another failed rescue mission but Washington has not confirmed the claim.

""""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,"""" she said.

She had released a video pleading with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) to let him live, describing her older brother as a romantic who """"always believes the best in people"""".

Mr Somers¡¯ father, Michael, called his son """"a good friend of Yemen and the Yemeni people"""" and asked for his safe release and his mother and brother appealed to his captors to spare him, saying he """"was only trying to do good"""".

According to a statement on the website of Yemen's defence ministry, a hostage rescue attempt on Saturday morning was successful.

A drone struck a suspected AQAP hideout at dawn in Yemen's southern Shabwa province, it said, and a subsequent raid freed an unnamed US hostage and killed 10 extremists. It was unclear whether the hostage described was Mr Somers.

No further details have emerged of Saturday's operation but the Pentagon admitted on Thursday that a secret raid last month had got the wrong location.

Special forces arrived at the target location, in a remote al-Qaeda safe haven in the desert near Yemen¡¯s border with Saudi Arabia, to find Mr Somers was not there.

The American government considers AQAP to be the world's most dangerous arm of the international terrorist organisation after linking it to several failed attacks on US soil.

Mr Somers was born in Britain and holds dual US-UK citizenship. Having spent most of his life in the United States, he worked for two years in Yemen as a freelance photojournalist, sub-editor and interpreter for English language newspapers.

American authorities rarely discuss their controversial drone strike campaign in Yemen, which are known to cause civilian casualties, legitimising violent resistance against US intervention in the country.

Al-Qaeda and Islamist militants have gained a foothold in large parts of southern and eastern Yemen, where the government is struggling to exert control outside main cities.

The Pentagon has not replied to The Independent's request for confirmation.

1070,"GAZA CITY (Ma'an) -- Hundreds of Palestinians were evacuated from their homes Sunday morning after Israeli authorities opened a number of dams near the border, flooding the Gaza Valley in the wake of a recent severe winter storm.

The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the Ministry of Public Works had evacuated more than 80 families from both sides of the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters.

Gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down. 

The storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands, including many of the approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel's assault over summer.

The suffering is compounded by the fact that Israel has maintained a complete siege over Gaza for the last eight years, severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators. It has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes, as construction materials are largely banned from entering. 

Gaza civil defense services spokesman Muhammad al-Midana warned that further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams in the area, noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the Israel border through the valley and into the Mediterranean sea.

Evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighborhood in the central Gaza Strip. 





The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) is a wetland located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It is called HaBesor in Hebrew, and it flows from two streams -- one whose source runs from near Beersheba, and the other from near Hebron.

Israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside Gaza, and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area. 

Locals have continued to use it to dispose of their waste for lack of other ways to do so, however, creating an environmental hazard.

This is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the Gaza Valley dams.

In Dec. 2013, Israeli authorities also opened the dams amid heavy flooding in the Gaza Strip. The resulting floods damaged dozens of homes and forces many families in the area from their homes.

In 2010, the dams were opened as well, forcing 100 families from their homes. At the time civil defense services said that they had managed to save seven people who had been at risk of drowning."

The incident comes just a day after police killed a Muslim convert in Quebec after he had hit two soldiers with his car.

From the Associated Press:

OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) -- Police say a soldier standing guard at the National War Memorial has been by an unknown gunman.

Ottawa police confirmed they had a call at 9:52 a.m. Wednesday with a report of shots fired, and witnesses reported seeing a gunman running toward Parliament Hill, which is under lockdown. Others on the Hill told Canadian Press they heard shots being fired in several different corridors.

The top spokesman for Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Harper was safe and had left Parliament Hill.

Emergency responders are still on the scene and paramedics took the wounded soldier away in an ambulance.

The incident comes just two days after two Canadian soldiers were run over - and one of them killed - in Quebec by a man with jihadist sympathies."
1073,"A small meteorite landed near the international airport in the Nicaraguan capital, Managua, on Saturday night, government officials say.

Residents reported hearing a loud bang and feeling the impact, which left a crater 12m (40ft) wide and 5m deep.

Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said the meteorite seemed to have broken off an asteroid which was passing close to Earth.

She said international experts had been called in to investigate further.

No-one was hurt when it hit the wooded area near the international airport and an air force base.

'Like a bomb'

An adviser to Nicaragua's Institute of Earth Studies (Ineter), Wilfried Strauch, said he was """"convinced it was a meteorite"""" which caused the impact.

Experts studying the crater said it was not clear whether the meteorite had disintegrated upon impact or had been blasted into soil.

Locals said they heard a large blast just before midnight local time and reported a burning smell.

""""We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,"""" Jorge Santamaria told Associated Press news agency.

Asteroid link?

Ineter scientist Jose Millan said that """"we need to celebrate the fact that it fell in an area where, thank God, it didn't cause any danger to the population"""".

Managua, which has more than a million inhabitants is densely populated.

""""All the evidence that we've confirmed at the site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event,"""" he said.

""""We have the seismic register which coincides with the time of impact, and the typical characteristic that it produces a cone in the place of impact,"""" he added.

Astronomer Humberto Saballos said the meteorite could have broken off from the 2014RC asteroid which passed Earth at the same time.

2014RC, which is the size of a house, came closest to earth at 18:18 GMT on Sunday, when it passed over New Zealand at a distance of about 40,000km (25,000 miles).

The asteroid was first discovered on 31 August and, at its closest approach, was about one-tenth of the distance from the centre of Earth to the Moon, Nasa said in a statement.

It is expected to orbit near Earth again in the future.

In February 2013, a meteorite exploded over Chelyabinsk in Central Russia, injuring more than 1,000 people.

Nasa currently tracks more than 11,000 asteroids in orbits that pass relatively close to Earth."
1074,"Apple is in negotiations to make the Apple TV a launch destination for HBO's standalone streaming service reportedly called """"HBO Now,"""" which could launch in time for the fifth season of Game of Thrones premiering April 12, according to a new report.

Plans to launch a streaming service independent of a cable or satellite subscription have been public knowledge since October. Until now, though, there was no name attached, or any pricing or availability details.

But on Wednesday, a new report from the International Business Times claimed that the service, said to be known as """"HBO Now,"""" will cost $15 per month ? about as much as viewers would pay a cable company, though providers often force customers to pay for additional bundles if they want HBO.

Apple has allegedly been """"most aggressive"""" in trying to secure an Apple TV deal. The set-top box is already one of the homes to HBO Go, which requires an authenticated subscription through cable providers, but it's believed that Apple could add a second app for HBO Now.

HBO's development partner on the service is said to be Major League Baseball Advanced Media. That company is reportedly building both the back-end and the front-end, but with some leeway on its deadlines so HBO executives can be sure the service works at launch.

During last year's season premiere of Game of Thrones, the on-demand HBO Go service collapsed under network traffic. That left some people waiting hours or days before they could stream the fourth season's first episode.

Apart from the Apple TV, HBO Now will likely appear on other platforms where HBO already has a presence, such as Roku and Xbox. It could have a significant impact on the cable and satellite industry, which has leveraged networks like HBO and sports channels to deter people from jumping ship to streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu."
1075,"The tale of the Harvard Business School professor who flipped out because he¡¯d been overcharged $4 by a Chinese restaurant took an ugly turn Wednesday night.

Edelman¡¯s domain name, benedelman.org, is easily found on the Web, and it¡¯s not difficult to send an email using any address you like.

One clue is that all of the legitimate emails Boston.com has posted from Edelman are marked as coming from ¡°Ben Edelman,¡± whereas the racist email and subsequent apology were from ¡°ben@benedelman.org.¡±

Despite the retraction, Boston.com as of this moment is still all-in on the rest of its Edelman package. We¡¯ll see what, if anything, comes next."
1076,"This post has been updated with additional reporting.

The Islamic State has released a new video in which it brags that it recovered weapons and supplies that the U.S. military intended to deliver to Kurdish fighters, who are locked in a fight with the militants over control of the Syrian border town of Kobane.

The SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist social media accounts, drew attention to the video Tuesday. At one point, it appears to show a masked militant raking his hands through a crate filled with hand grenades.

A U.S. Central Command spokesman said he was looking into the reports. In a news release Monday, U.S. military officials acknowledged launching one airstrike near Kobane that they said destroyed ¡°a U.S. airdrop of Kurdish supplies¡± to prevent ¡°these supplies from falling into enemy hands.¡±

¡°All other resupply bundles were successfully delivered,¡± the CENTCOM news release said, without specifying what was in the shipment.

Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said Tuesday afternoon that analysts were working to determine what happened. The Defense Department is aware that one bundle didn¡¯t make it into the right hands, and is not sure whether the one that appears in the video is the same one CENTCOM already reported destroying.

On Tuesday, the U.S. military announced another four airstrikes near Kobane, saying it hit Islamic State fighting positions, a building occupied by the militants, and ¡°a large ISIL unit,¡± using one of the acronyms for the group. The U.S. has launched dozens of airstrikes around Kobane in the last week, as the militants besiege the town.

The incident highlights the difficulty in making sure all airdrops are accurate, even with GPS-guided parachutes that the Air Force commonly uses. Airdrops of food and water to religious minorities trapped on mountain cliffs in northern Iraq in August hit the mark about 80 percent of the time, Pentagon officials said at the time.

The United States began dropping weapons, ammunition, medical supplies and other equipment to fighters defending Kobane on Sunday night, in part because Turkey would not allow Kurdish fighters to cross its borders into Kobane to bolster the town¡¯s defenses. Turkish officials said they changed their mind on Monday, but the deal is tentative and depends on whether separate Kurdish groups can resolve longterm differences to confront the Islamic State.

¡°Removing Godane from the battlefield is a major symbolic and operational loss to al-Shabab,¡± Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement.

U.S. military officials had acknowledged that they were trying to kill Godane in Monday¡¯s air assault on a Shabab compound in southern Somalia. But they had been cautious about asserting the mission was successful, mindful of reports of other al-Qaeda leaders who had been killed in drone attacks, only to resurface later.

The State Department had offered a $7 million reward for information leading to Godane¡¯s arrest. It identified him as a 37-year-old native of northern Somalia who, among other aliases, went by the names Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr and Ahmed Abdi Aw Mohamed.

Monday¡¯s drone strike was the most aggressive U.S. military operation in Somalia in nearly a year, and it came as the Obama administration was already grappling with security crises in Iraq, Syria and Ukraine.

Counterterrorism officials and analysts have described Godane as a particularly ruthless jihadi leader who eliminated several rivals within al-Shabab, either by killing them or forcing them to go underground.

It was unclear who might succeed him as leader of the network. Although al-Shabab often posts comments from the group on social media and gives interviews with journalists in Somalia, it has been mum about whether he survived the airstrike."
1085,"Axl Rose is NOT dead. He¡¯s the victim of a new death hoax, designed to look like an MSNBC report. Do not believe it. Axl Rose is alive and hopefully well.

The awful hoax comes from the jerks behind the MSNBC.website URL, which has no affiliation with the real news outlet and tries to fool people into clicking on bogus stories. A new phony report has the headline, ¡°Sources: Guns N¡¯ Roses Frontman Axl Rose Found Dead in West Hollywood Home at Age 52.¡±

1087,"Russian President Vladimir Putin was pooped on by a bird while giving a speech unveiling a World War One monument in Moscow on Friday. You can see the freedom bombs land at 0:11 into the above video or you can watch it on repeat, forever, in the gif below.

The Moscow bird poop incident of 2014 is a small but symbolically satisfying comeuppance for Putin's involvement in Ukraine, where fighting with Russia-backed separatists has killed hundreds of Ukrainians and, two weeks ago, 298 civilians flying overhead in Malaysian Airlines flight 17. Europe and the US have punished Russia with economic sanctions meant to deter further aggression, but on Friday this unknown bird launched some targeted sanctions against the man himself.

Rn0eaqx

This being Russia, getting pooped on by a bird wasn't even the most ridiculous part of Putin's WWI speech. Putin warned that the lesson of WWI was ? fair warning, irony is going to die forever at the end of this sentence ? to avoid excessive ambitions in war. """"Humankind should grasp one truth: violence generates violence,"""" said the man whose overt and ongoing support for separatist rebels in Ukraine, which he also invaded to annex Crimea, has helped claim hundreds of lives and stirred up months of crisis.

""""It was on the eve of WWI when Russia did everything possible to solve the conflict peacefully, without bloodshed, between Serbia and Austria-Hungary,"""" Putin said, repeating an old Russian complaint that only it really wants peace but is ignored by an aggressive West. """"But Russia wasn't heard. And it had to respond to the challenge in order to protect the [fellow] Slavic nation.""""

I'm not sure whether Putin means this as an explicit nod to his involvement in Ukraine, but Russia's meddling there has often been internally premised on the idea that Russia must save the Russian-speakers in Ukraine's east. So there would seem to be a parallel. More ironically, the Ukrainians who are fighting and dying to keep Putin out of their country are themselves Slavic, but must have forgotten to thank Putin for his peace-seeking, pan-Slavic magnanimity."

I'm not going to dignify the terrorists by posting the video here, you can look it up on your own if you'd like. A warning, extremely violent and difficult to watch. 

Wright's fellow journalist Ihan Tanir gave some background on the situation on Twitter.

More from Noah Rothman:

The American photojournalist James Wright Foley was working for Agence France Presse when he was captured crossing the Syria-Turkish border in 2012. The American war reporter had previously been held for six weeks by pro-Gaddafi forces in Libya while covering that conflict. Some believed that his capture would be similarly short-lived. Tragically, that would not be the case.

¡°On November 22, 2012, James Wright Foley, a freelance photo journalist, was taken by an organized gang after departing from an internet caf? in Binesh, Syria,¡± the FBI noted in November, 2012. ¡°Foley had employed a translator to help him travel across the Syrian-Turkish border. The translator was also taken, but later released.¡±
Swift justice is in order. Immediately. May his family find peace in this extremely difficult time.

1094,"On Saturday, the entire Internet watched in horror and then cautious joy as a drunk and/or high man in the Dallas-Forth Worth airport assaulted a random bystander he believed was gay. The attacker was then quickly subdued by a crowd of people. The video, first posted by Raw Story, has been viewed nearly two million times. But only one person, comedian and friend of Jezebel Sarah Benincasa, noticed that one of the guys tackling said gay-basher looks a lot like actor and decent-seeming human being Paul Rudd.

Here's the video once again, via Raw Story:



As you can see, the glassy-eyed gentleman attacks the guy in the pink shirt because he suspects him of being """"a queer"""" and then, when asked why he did that, screams """"Because America!"""" (It's great that a crowd of people worked to subdue him; slightly less great that an airport security guard can be seen meandering past him moments before he attacks the pink-shirted man, ignoring him as he screams threats and takes his sweatshirt off.)

In her viewing of the video, Benincasa noticed that around 1:30, one of the people dog-piling the man really, really looks like Paul Rudd. Like, a lot:

As Wonkette reported, another Twitter user, @msigs, found a girl who'd tweeted about seeing Paul Rudd that day, and got her to confirm he was wearing what he had on the video: a checked shirt and a sport coat.


However, that Twitter user appears to have seen Rudd on a flight out of Savannah, Georgia, and we don't know for sure that he stopped in Dallas. (Do people with Paul Rudd-level money really have layovers?)

So, the jury is still out on this one, even as the glorious #PaulRuddSavesLives hashtag is engulfing Twitter. But, if confirmed, it's going to be almost as great ? and, let's be frank, arousing ? as that time Ryan Gosling broke up a street fight.

1097,"Islamic State has released a video showing the beheading of British hostage David Haines.

It comes just hours after his family issued a public plea for his captors to contact them.

The Foreign Office said it was """"working urgently to verify"""" the video and offering Mr Haines's family support.

David Cameron, the Prime Minister, said: """"The murder of David Haines is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to his family who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude.""""

He added: """"We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.""""

Mr Haines, 44, was kidnapped last year as he delivered humanitarian aid in Syria.

His whereabouts were only revealed this month when he was shown kneeling in the sand, wearing an orange jumpsuit, in a video produced by jihadists of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) which also showed the murder of Steven Sotloff, an American journalist.

A masked man, who has become known as ¡°Jihadi John¡±, said Mr Haines would be next if the West did not halt operations against Isil.

In the latest video, he is also wearing a orange jumpsuit and is kneeling on the sand.

It begins with a clip from David Cameron. A man believed to be Mr Haines then looks into the camera and says: """"My name is David Cawthorne Haines. I would like to delcare that I hold you David Cameron entirely responsible for my execution.

""""You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State just as your predecessor Tony Blair did, following a trend against our British prime ministers who can't find the courage to say no to the Americans.

""""Unfortunately it is we the British public that in the end will pay the price for our Parliament's selfish decisions.""""

Twitter: David Cameron - The murder of David Haines is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to his family who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude.

Twitter: David Cameron - We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.

In a statement, the Foreign and Commonwealth said: """"We are aware of the video.

""""We are working urgently to verify the content. If true, this is another disgusting murder. We are offering the family every support possible.

""""They have asked to be left alone at this time.""""

Mr Cameron rushed back to Downing Street for crisis talks with his advisers, officials and intelligence chiefs on Saturday night. He arrived at No 10 just after midnight.

He chaired a COBRA meeting on Sunday morning.

In the Haines family¡¯s short statement - which was released earlier on Saturday by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office - the British captive¡¯s relatives said: ¡°We are the family of David Haines.

¡°We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply.We are asking those holding David to make contact with us.¡±

No further details of their messages were released.

Mr Haines had worked for aid agencies in some of the world¡¯s worst trouble spots, including Libya and South Sudan.

He was travelling in a car through northern Syria in March last year when he was abducted along with an Italian colleague, who was later released. He was working for a French aid organisation, Agency for Technical Co-operation and Development (Acted).

Mr Haines is believed to have been kidnapped by a gang which later sold him on to Isil.

His identity remained a closely guarded secret for 19 months in a bid to increase the chances of a negotiated release.

But the situation changed dramatically with the execution first of James Foley, another American journalist, and then Mr Sotloff with the subsequent appearance of Mr Haines in the second murder video.

MPs reacted with horror and anger to the reports on Saturday night.

Ed Vaizey, a government minister and Conservative MP, said he was ¡°so sad and angry¡± to hear reports of Mr Haines¡¯s murder.

Stella Creasy, a Labour MP and shadow minister, said she was ¡°shocked and horrified¡± to see reports that Mr Haines had been killed. ¡°Hoping mistaken but fear not,¡± she said.

Dan Jarvis, another senior Labour MP, said he was ¡°sickened¡±.

Tim Farron, President of the Liberal Democrats, said: ¡°My thoughts and prayers are with David Haines' family and friends tonight.¡±

Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, said: ¡°I am sickened at the disgusting, barbaric killing of David Haines.

¡°He was somebody whose only purpose was to help innocent people, themselves victims of conflict.

¡°That ISIL would choose to kill him says everything about their warped logic and murderous ways.

¡°Acts like this will not weaken but strengthen the resolve of Britain and the international community to defeat ISIL and their ideology.

¡°My deepest condolences and thoughts are with his family as they cope with this terrible crime. And the hearts of the British people will go out to them.¡±

Lord Dannatt, the former head of the Army, said the UK should respond by playing its role in the assault against IS promised by US president Barack Obama.

""""What we absolutely need to do is not be cowed in any way by yet another foul murder of a hostage,"""" he told Sky News.

""""But to develop the strategy into a sensible military campaign in coalition with regional players such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan and other countries in the area.

""""We can support them to confront, attack and defeat the Islamic State jihadi fighters ... and make sure this cancer is removed from the region before it spreads more widely.""""

The United States also """"strongly condemned"""" the killing.

In a statement, the White House said: """"Our hearts go out to the family of Mr Haines and to the people of the United Kingdom. The United States stands shoulder to shoulder tonight with our close friend and ally in grief and resolve.

""""We will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world."""""

A report in November shared similar information, noting that Apple would be relying heavily on Samsung for iPhone 6 and Apple Watch components. Namely, Apple was said to be concerned about NAND flash, with its cheaper and slower TLC (triple-level cell) flash memory for larger-capacity iPhone 6 and 6 Plus models said to be the source of crashing issues. Those issues, along with Samsung's competitive prices, were said to be the primary reasons in bringing Apple back to negotiations with the South Korean company.

Apple is said to be targeting a March launch for the Apple Watch, as the company is said to be refining the device's """"Watch OS"""" software and working on hardware components like the inductive charging mechanism.

As previously described in rumors, the next MacBook Air will have roughly the same footprint as the current 11-inch model, but include a 12-inch display nestled inside narrower bezels. The machine's keyboard will also extend from edge to edge while the speakers move to a set of grilles above the keyboard.

Comparison of 12-inch Retina MacBook Air (left) with current 11-inch MacBook Air (right)
As part of Apple's effort to reduce the thickness of the MacBook Air, the new 12-inch model will do away with nearly all of the ports currently found on the machine, including the usual USB and MagSafe ports. Instead, the machine's sides will include only a headphone jack, a pair of microphones, and a USB Type-C port that appears set to handle both connectivity and charging.

Apple's new Retina MacBook Air is expected to run on new Broadwell Core M to allow for the thin, fanless design and perhaps come in multiple color options similar to the company's iPhone and iPad lineups. The machine has been rumored to be entering production as soon as this month, although it is unclear whether Apple may wait until its Worldwide Developers Conference in June to launch the device or introduce it earlier in the year.

Out of the 28 girls, seven reportedly came home pregnant.

The students were suppose to be touring museums, but apparently, much more went on. Shortly after the trip, the seven girls, who range from ages 13 to 15, all turned up pregnant at the same time and that¡¯s when it was discovered that they all conceived on the trip.

Needless to say, the parents are outraged. As a matter of fact, many of the parents are blaming school administrators and chaperones for lack of supervision on the five-day excursion. However, a Bosnian gynecologist feels otherwise. argues that parents and school officials are equally responsible due to the lack of sexual education children in the receive.

¡°That is the trend of today. But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school.

1106,"KOBANE , Syria, Dec. 1 (UPI) -- There are conflicting reports whether Gill Rosenberg, a Canadian-Israeli woman who claims to have joined the fight against the Islamic State, has been captured.
Rosenberg, 31, told Israeli radio she traveled from Israel to Iraq in November to join a Kurdish militia, the only anti-IS group encouraging women to enter combat. IS-affiliated websites claimed over the weekend she was captured near locations where Kurdish and IS forces were engaged in battle, but Kurdish sources told the Jerusalem Post the reports of her capture were merely IS propaganda.

Two messages have appeared on the Facebook social media website since Sunday night, indicating Rosenberg was not taken prisoner. Facebook user Oliver Bruno wrote """"Gill is safe and she is not active on Facebook cause (sic) she has no internet access. ISIS's supporters launched a rumor on social media that she was captured in ?#?Kobani which is not true, simply because Gill is at least 300 km. from Kobani.""""

The message would imply Rosenberg left Israel to fight but was some 186 miles away from Kobane, a town on the Syria-Turkey border and the scene of two months of fighting.

A later message from Bruno said the head of the YPG Kurdish forces in Kobane """"categorically refuted these allegations.""""

Another message from Facebook user Emanuela Siyar Barzani, citing a """"qualified"""" source, noted """"Everything is fine with Gill.""""

On Saturday, an online form posted a message from a pro-IS contributor, claiming a """"female Zionist soldier"""" was captured in Kobane by IS forces, the SITE Intelligence Group reported. Speculation began that the soldier in question was Rosenberg, but there has been no confirmation.

The Canadian government's Department of Foreign Affairs said it was investigating the reports, but did not confirm Rosenberg, who is from White Rock, B.C., had been captured."
1107,"BEIRUT: A statement attributed to the Islamic State group claimed an American female hostage was killed in a Jordanian airstrike on Friday on the outskirts of the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, the extremist group's main stronghold.

The statement identified the woman as Kayla Jean Mueller and said she was killed during Muslim prayers - which usually take place around midday on Fridays - in airstrikes that targeted """"the same location for more than an hour.""""

No Islamic State militants were killed in the airstrikes, the statement further claimed.

It published photos allegedly of the bombed site, showing a severely damaged brown colored three-story building - but no images of the woman.

American officials said they were looking into the report, and the White House said it did not have immediate comment. There was also no immediate comment from the Jordanian government.

The IS statement could not be independently verified. It appeared on a militant website commonly used by IS and was also distributed by IS-affiliated Twitter users.

Mueller, of Prescott, Arizona, had been working in Turkey assisting Syrian refugees, according to a 2013 article in The Daily Courier, her hometown newspaper. The 26-year-old told the paper that she was drawn to help with the situation in Syria.

""""For as long as I live, I will not let this suffering be normal,"""" she said. """"It's important to stop and realize what we have, why we have it and how privileged we are. And from that place, start caring and get a lot done.""""

According to the local paper, Mueller had been working with the humanitarian aid agency Support to Life, as well as a local NGO that helped female Syrian refugees develop skills.

A 2007 article about Mueller from the same local newspaper said she was a student at Northern Arizona University and was active in the Save Darfur Coalition.

On Sunday, President Barack Obama said the U.S. was """"deploying all the assets that we can"""" to find Mueller.

""""We are in very close contact with the family trying to keep them updated,"""" he said in an interview with NBC's Today Show. """"Obviously this is something that is heart-breaking for the family and we want to make sure we do anything we can to make sure that any American citizen is rescued from this situation.""""

If her death is confirmed, she would be the fourth American to die while in the captivity of the Islamic State militants. Three other Americans, journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid worker Peter Kassig were beheaded by the group.

Jordan, which is part of a U.S.-led coalition bombing Islamic State group targets in Syria, stepped up its attacks after IS announced it had killed a captive Jordanian pilot. The Syrian government said Thursday that dozens of Jordanian fighter jets had bombed Islamic State training centers and weapons storage sites. It did not say where the attacks occurred.

The whereabouts of the students, who disappeared after a confrontation with police in late September, have been the subject of mass protests in the state.

Authorities have been conducting DNA tests on the 28 badly burned bodies found in the graves since discovering them earlier this month. Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said tests were continuing on four additional graves uncovered last week.

State governor Angel Aguirre said some of the bodies could have been earlier victims of criminal gangs, and some of them seemed to have been buried ¡°months ago.¡±

Murillo Karam, speaking at a news conference Tuesday, added that 14 additional police officers were arrested over the disappearances. So far, 50 people, mostly police, have been arrested for their roles in the incident, and prosecutors accuse police of colluding with a local gang known as Guerreros Unidos. The police chief and mayor of Iguala, the town where the confrontation between police and students occurred, have also been accused of ties with the gang. Both are currently in hiding.

On Tuesday, the leader of Guerreros Unidos, Benjamin Mondragon, committed suicide by shooting himself when confronted by security forces in the neighboring state of Morelos. Federal authorities said it wasn¡¯t clear whether Mondragon was involved with the student disappearances.

Hundreds of protesters, many from the teachers¡¯ college that the missing students had attended, took to the streets in Guerrero¡¯s capital of Chilpancingo this week over the disappearances. The protests turned chaotic on Tuesday when demonstrators overtook state government buildings, ransacked offices and burned parts of the complex. On Tuesday, they took over bank branches and a local radio station and vowed to keep up the pressure on Guerrero¡¯s government until the missing students were found."
1115,"Militants reportedly have three captured jets and witnesses cited as saying they have seen planes flying low over Aleppo

Islamic State (Isis) is takings its first steps towards building an air force by training pilots to fly captured fighter planes, according to a group monitoring the conflict in Syria.

Isis is using lots of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, artillery and Jeeps taken from the Syrian and Iraqi armies but this is the first report that it has planes in the air.

Isis, which took the US by surprise this year with its rapid territorial expansion in Syria and Iraq, has three Russian-built MiG jets, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), which appears to have a good network of observers on the ground and has often proved reliable in the past.

Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the British-based group, said Isis has trainers who had gained experience in the Iraqi air force under former president Saddam Hussein.

Abdulrahman cited witnesses who had seen the planes flying low over Aleppo, in rebel-held northern Syria.

If Isis was able to train pilots, they could mount 9/11-style suicide attacks on key installations in Damascus or Baghdad.

Defence analysts said that while this is feasible, they were extremely sceptical. ¡°There is a small chance but not a big chance,¡± said Afzal Ashraf, a former RAF captain, counter-terrorism specialist and consultant at the London-based Royal United Services Institute(Rusi).

It was feasible to train pilots for small aircraft but it would be a struggle to do the same with an advanced fighter jet. Such jets would require frequent maintenance as well as a good navigation system and air traffic control, Ashraf said.

Such planes could be easily picked off by US, UK, Turkish or even Syrian planes or air defences. The UK is flying reconnaissance and bombing missions only over Iraq while the US is engaged in both Iraq and Syria.

In February last year, the SOHR reported the capture of the al-Jarrah military airport near Aleppo, which had been held by Assad¡¯s forces. The MiG fighters were said to have been taken at the time.

The monitoring group reported witnesses saying the planes flying low over Aleppo recently appeared to be MiG 21s or MiG 23s and had taken off from and returned to the nearby al-Jarrah base. It added that training courses are taking place at the base.

The SOHR said it did not know whether the planes were armed with missiles.

Isis has taken swathes of Sunni-dominated territory in Iraq and is on the outskirts of Baghdad.

Raffaello Pantucci, a counter-terrorist specialist at Rusi, said he had seen footage of captured planes and questioned their viability. ¡°They were covered in bird shit,¡± he said.

Pantucci said they would pose no problem for the sophisticated air defence capabilities of the US and its Nato ally Turkey, and even to a lesser extent those of Syria¡¯s President Bashar-al-Assad.

Ashraf said of the former Iraqi air force pilots reported to have joined Isis that it would be hard for them to keep up with the latest advances. ¡°Flying is a very perishable skill,¡± he said.

He predicted they were almost certain to crash. ¡°You have to be able to fly and to take off and to navigate. If you do not know what you are doing, you are likely to stall it,¡± Ashraf said."

A video posted on YouTube, later removed, purported to show the execution of James Foley after he recited a statement in which he called the U.S. government ¡°my real killers.¡± A second prisoner, said to be Steven Joel Sotloff, like Foley an American journalist who disappeared while covering Syria¡¯s civil war, then appears in the video.

The masked executioner, speaking in English with what sounds like a British accent, identifies Sotloff and says that ¡°the life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.¡±

U.S. intelligence officials said they were still evaluating the video and could not immediately authenticate it.

A White House statement said, ¡°We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL,¡± one of several acronyms associated with the militants.

¡°The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity,¡± said the statement by National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. ¡°If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.¡±

President Obama was briefed on the video aboard Air Force One as he returned to his Martha¡¯s Vineyard vacation and will be updated on further developments, the White House said.

¡°If true, the murder of James Foley is shocking and depraved,¡± British Prime Minister David Cameron said on Twitter. His office said Wednesday he was cutting short a family vacation and returning to London to chair emergency meetings on Iraq and Syria.

In an interview with the BBC, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond acknowledged that the apparent executioner spoke with a British accent and said the video seemed to be genuine.

Hundreds of Britons are believed to have traveled to Syria to fight in the country¡¯s civil war, including many who have joined the Islamic State.

¡°We¡¯re absolutely aware that there are significant numbers of British nationals involved in terrible crimes, probably in the commission of atrocities,¡± Hammond said. ¡°Many of these people may seek at some point to return to the U.K., and they would then pose a direct threat to our domestic security.¡±

A European intelligence official said the British government was examining the video, and the speech of the purported executioner, to compare it with former Guantanamo Bay prisoners and other British residents believed to have joined the Islamic State.

Both prisoners in the video are wearing orange shirts and pants, similar to orange jumpsuits worn by detainees at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A similar outfit, believed to be a jihadist symbol of the prison, was worn by Nicholas Berg, an American businessman kidnapped in Iraq in 2004 whose execution by an Islamic State precursor organization was recorded on video and posted online.

Foley, 40, was working in Syria for the Boston-based news Web site Global¡©Post when he disappeared on Thanksgiving in 2012.

Philip Balboni, GlobalPost¡¯s chief executive and co-founder, said in a statement: ¡°On behalf of John and Diane Foley, and also GlobalPost, we deeply appreciate all of the messages of sympathy and support that have poured in since the news of Jim¡¯s possible execution first broke. We have been informed that the FBI is in the process of evaluating the video posted by the Islamic State to determine if it is authentic. Until we have that determination, we will not be in a position to make any further statement. We ask for your prayers for Jim and his family.¡±

In a statement Tuesday night on a Facebook page dedicated to his freedom, Foley¡¯s mother appeared to accept that the video was authentic. ¡°We have never been prouder of our son Jim,¡± Diane Foley wrote. ¡°He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people.

¡°We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.¡±

Praising James Foley as ¡°an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person,¡± she asked that the family¡¯s privacy be respected.

Sotloff, a freelancer who worked for several news organizations, disappeared in Syria in August 2013.

In addition to Foley and Sotloff, at least three other Americans are believed to be captives in Syria, including Austin Tice, a freelance journalist whose articles appeared in McClatchy publications and The Washington Post before his disappearance in August 2012, according to a 2013 GlobalPost article. No one has claimed to be holding them.

According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 66 journalists, all but 10 of them Syrian, have been killed covering the Syrian war. If the video is authenticated, Foley would be the first American journalist known to be executed since the conflict began in early 2011. The video evoked the 2002 taped execution in Pakistan of Wall Street Journal correspondent Daniel Pearl by al-Qaeda.

The Islamic State, an offshoot of al-Qaeda, is the most powerful among a number of extremist organizations that have emerged during the Syrian civil war, which began as a popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Fighting against both Assad and U.S.-backed rebels, the militants now control much of eastern Syria and claim to have established an Islamic caliphate spanning Syria and neighboring Iraq.

As the group has grown, it has merged with the group formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq, under the leadership of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. According to U.S. intelligence, it numbers in the thousands, including foreign fighters from Europe and the United States.

In April, Islamic State fighters swept across the border into northern Iraq, taking over the city of Mosul before moving southward to within 60 miles of Baghdad. Extensive reports of executions, including beheadings and crucifixions, have emerged from areas under the group¡¯s control.

This month, amid reports of stranded and besieged Iraqi minorities threatened with execution, the militants advanced eastward toward Irbil, the capital of the semiautonomous Kurdish region of Iraq.

On Aug. 7, Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes to rescue stranded minorities and protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Irbil and Baghdad. On Monday, after a total of 68 strikes from jets, bombers and drones, Obama announced that Iraqi and Kurdish forces, with U.S. air support, had retaken a strategic dam north of Mosul from the militants and that they had been pushed back from Irbil.

Within hours of that announcement, the Islamic State posted an online message warning it would attack Americans ¡°in any place¡± in response to the airstrikes. ¡°We will drown all of you in blood,¡± it said.

The title of the video posted Tuesday was ¡°A Message to America¡± and was produced by the Islamic State¡¯s media arm, according to the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist Web sites.

A masked man dressed in black is shown standing in an unidentified desert location beside a prisoner kneeling beside him with his hands behind his back. ¡°Obama authorized military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war against Muslims,¡± the masked man says.

The video then shows a clip of Obama¡¯s Aug. 7 announcement, followed by a statement from the prisoner.

¡°I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,¡± he says. He asks his parents not to accept ¡°any meager compensation from the same people who effectively hit the last nail in my coffin with the recent aerial campaign in Iraq.¡±

The prisoner also appeals to ¡°my brother John, who is a member of the U.S. Air Force,¡± to ¡°think about what you are doing.¡±

¡°I wish I had more time,¡± he says. ¡°I wish I could have the hope for freedom to see my family once again, but that ship has sailed. I guess all in all, I wish I wasn¡¯t an American.¡±

The masked man then identifies the prisoner as ¡°James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country.¡± He then reaches down with a large knife and begins the apparent beheading of the prisoner; the screen fades to black and the next image is of a body with a head placed upon its chest.

The masked man then appears with another prisoner, identified as Sotloff, in a similar kneeling position.

Foley reported from some of the most dangerous recent crises and was imprisoned for 44 days in Libya in 2011 by forces loyal to deposed leader Moammar Gaddafi. According to Global¡©Post, two eyewitnesses saw his interception by a group of armed men in a silver-colored van on a road near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Nov. 22, 2012.

Since then, Global¡©Post ¡°has mounted an extensive international investigation . . . to determine who kidnapped Foley and where he was being held,¡± Global¡©Post said in an article on its Web site late Tuesday.

1119,"A British-born photographer held hostage by al Qaida in Yemen has been killed in a failed rescue attempt, his sister has said.

Lucy Somers told the Associated Press that she was informed of her brother's death by FBI agents today.

Luke Somers, 33, an American citizen, was captured in the Yemeni capital Sana'a more than a year ago by the extremist Islamic group.

Luke Somers was kidnapped over a year ago by al Qaida (AP Photo/Hani Mohammed)

Earlier this week al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) issued a video with a message aimed at the US government threatening to kill the hostage if its demands were not met.

Lucy Somers said: """"We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace.""""

Last week the US said it had attempted a rescue operation to free a number of hostages, including Mr Somers, but that he had not been at the site of the raid.

The family of Mr Somers, who was captured in September 2013, had earlier pleaded for him to be released.

In an online video Miss Somers described her older brother as a romantic who """"always believes the best in people."""" She added: """"Please let him live.""""

His father Michael said Mr Somers was """"a good friend of Yemen and the Yemeni people"""".

It came after the release of the AQAP video which begins with a reading in Arabic from Nasser bin Ali al Ansi, an AQAP official, before Mr Somers appears and gives a statement in English.

He said: """"My name is Luke Somers. I'm 33 years old. I was born in England, but I carry American citizenship and have lived in America for most of my life.

""""It's now been well over a year since I've been kidnapped in Sana'a. Basically, I'm looking for any help that can get me out of this situation. I'm certain that my life is in danger.

""""So as I sit here now, I ask if anything can be done, please let it be done. Thank you very much.""""

Al Ansi gave the US government three days to meet the demands or """"otherwise, the American hostage held by us will meet his inevitable fate"""".

The three-minute video also features Ansi speaking about American activity in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq as well as recent air strikes in Syria.

It follows similar videos by another extremist militant group, Islamic State (IS), which has already killed two British hostages and three American hostages in videos released on social media.

IS has posted a series of videos online showing the separate murders of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, US aid worker Peter Kassig and two British aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning.

Footage claiming to show Mr Henning's murder appeared on the internet just days after the UK joined US-led air strikes against the terrorists in Iraq.

1120,"Pentagon investigating claims but admits one load missing and it would be embarrassing if it ended up in terror group¡¯s hands

A US airdrop of arms to besieged Kurds in Kobani appears to have missed its target and ended up in the hands of Islamic State (Isis) militants.

Video footage released by Isis shows what appears to be one of its fighters for in desert scrubland with a stack of boxes attached to a parachute. The boxes are opened to show an array of weapons, some rusty, some new. A canister is broken out to reveal a hand grenade.

The Pentagon said it was investigating the claim but admitted that one of its airdrops had gone missing. If confirmed, it would be an embarrassment for the US, given the advanced precision technology available to its air force.

The seemingly bungled airdrop comes against a steady stream of US-supplied weapons being lost to Isis forces, mainly from the dysfunctional Iraqi army. Isis is reported to have stolen seven American M1 Abrams tanks from three Iraqi army bases in Anbar province last week.

The Pentagon spokesman, Rear Admiral John Kirby, told reporters that analysts at Centcom headquarters in Tampa, Florida, were examining the video. ¡°We¡¯re still taking a look at it and assessing the validity of it,¡± he said. ¡°So I honestly don¡¯t know if that was one of the one dropped.¡±

The US began dropping munitions, supplied by Kurdish authorities in the semi-autonomous region of northern Iraq, to their compatriots in Kobani, which sits close to the Iraqi-Turkish border; Isis fighters have encircled much of the town.

Kirby confirmed the weapons shown in the video were the kind that were dropped. ¡°So it¡¯s not out of the realm of the possibility in that regard,¡± he said.

¡°I do want to add, though, that we are very confident that the vast majority of the bundles did end up in the right hands. In fact, we¡¯re only aware of one bundle that did not.¡±

The airdrops were carried out by three C-130 planes. The video shows a man in camouflage clothes and balaclava looking through the boxes of munitions. He says they were dropped by US forces and had been intended for the Kurds. He described them as the spoils of war.

As well as grenades, the boxes appeared to contain parts for rocket-propelled grenades. Some of the equipment appears to be east European in origin, which might seem odd given the weapons were dropped by Americans, but the munitions were supplied by the Kurdish authorities who had been stocking up.

Kirby said the situation in Kobani remained tense, with Kurdish forces in control of most of the city. The US-led coalition has mounted more than 130 air strikes round the town in an effort to stop Isis taking complete control.

While the US has carried out air strikes in Kobani, cloud cover last week prevented them hitting much of the rest of Iraq, particularly around the contested Mosul dam. If the dam was to fall to I, it would provide huge leverage for the group, a strategic loss with potentially catastrophic consequences.

Britain has been supplying the Kurdish semi-autonomous region with weapons but so far supplies have been limited. The Kurds report receiving about 40 heavy machine guns but say they badly need heavier equipment, in particular armoured vehicles."
